					<span>I enter, and I see thee in the gloom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the long aisles, O poet saturnine!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The air is filled with some unknown perfume;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The congregation of the dead make room</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thee to pass; the votive tapers shine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like rooks that haunt Ravenna’s groves of pine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the confessionals I hear arise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lamentations from the crypts below;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then a voice celestial that begins</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the pathetic words, “Although your sins</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As scarlet be,” and ends with “as the snow.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With snow-white veil and garments as of flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She stands before thee, who so long ago</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From which thy song and all its splendors came;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ice about thy heart melts as the snow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On mountain heights, and in swift overflow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou makest full confession; and a gleam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As of the dawn on some dark forest cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seems on thy lifted forehead to increase;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lethe and Eunoë⁠—the remembered dream</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the forgotten sorrow⁠—bring at last</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That perfect pardon which is perfect peace.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The little vessel of my genius now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of that second kingdom will I sing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But let dead Poesy here rise again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O holy Muses, since that I am yours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And here Calliope somewhat ascend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-532" id="noteref-532" epub:type="noteref">532</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My song accompanying with that sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which the miserable magpies felt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-533" id="noteref-533" epub:type="noteref">533</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sweet color of the oriental sapphire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-534" id="noteref-534" epub:type="noteref">534</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto mine eyes did recommence delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beauteous planet, that to love incites,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-535" id="noteref-535" epub:type="noteref">535</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was making all the orient to laugh,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-536" id="noteref-536" epub:type="noteref">536</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the other pole, and saw four stars<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-537" id="noteref-537" epub:type="noteref">537</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne’er seen before save by the primal people.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-538" id="noteref-538" epub:type="noteref">538</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O thou septentrional and widowed site,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because thou art deprived of seeing these!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When from regarding them I had withdrawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turning a little to the other pole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the Wain had disappeared already,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-539" id="noteref-539" epub:type="noteref">539</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw beside me an old man alone,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-540" id="noteref-540" epub:type="noteref">540</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Worthy of so much reverence in his look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That more owes not to father any son.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A long beard and with white hair intermingled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which a double list fell on his breast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rays of the four consecrated stars</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did so adorn his countenance with light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That him I saw as were the sun before him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-541" id="noteref-541" epub:type="noteref">541</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have fled away from the eternal prison?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moving those venerable plumes, he said:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-542" id="noteref-542" epub:type="noteref">542</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Who guided you? or who has been your lamp</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In issuing forth out of the night profound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever black makes the infernal valley?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or is there changed in heaven some counsel new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That being damned ye come unto my crags?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his words, and with his hands and signs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then answered him: “I came not of myself;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-543" id="noteref-543" epub:type="noteref">543</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I aided this one with my company.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since it is thy will more be unfolded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of our condition, how it truly is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one has never his last evening seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by his folly was so near to it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That very little time was there to turn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have said, I unto him was sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rescue him, and other way was none</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than this to which I have myself betaken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve shown him all the people of perdition,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now those spirits I intend to show</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As knoweth he who life for her refuses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou know’st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By us the eternal edicts are not broken;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-544" id="noteref-544" epub:type="noteref">544</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of that circle I, where are the chaste<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-545" id="noteref-545" epub:type="noteref">545</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For her love, then, incline thyself to us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will take back this grace from thee to her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If to be mentioned there below thou deignest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While I was on the other side,” then said he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That every grace she wished of me I granted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She can no longer move me, by that law</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go, then, and see thou gird this one about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-546" id="noteref-546" epub:type="noteref">546</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ’twere not fitting that the eye o’ercast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By any mist should go before the first</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Angel, who is of those of Paradise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This little island round about its base</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or that doth indurate, can there have life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter be not this way your return;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sun, which now is rising, will direct you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To take the mount by easier ascent.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With this he vanished; and I raised me up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without a word, and wholly drew myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he began: “Son, follow thou my steps;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let us turn back, for on this side declines</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The plain unto its lower boundaries.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-547" id="noteref-547" epub:type="noteref">547</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which fled before it, so that from afar</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I recognized the trembling of the sea.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the solitary plain we went</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one who unto the lost road returns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And till he finds it seems to go in vain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as we were come to where the dew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fights with the sun, and, being in a part</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where shadow falls, little evaporates,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-548" id="noteref-548" epub:type="noteref">548</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of his hands upon the grass outspread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In gentle manner did my Master place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I, who of his action was aware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There did he make in me uncovered wholly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hue which Hell had covered up in me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then came we down upon the desert shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which never yet saw navigate its waters</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Any that afterward had known return.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There he begirt me as the other pleased;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O marvellous! for even as he culled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The humble plant, such it sprang up again<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-549" id="noteref-549" epub:type="noteref">549</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suddenly there where he uprooted it.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose circle of meridian covers o’er</span>

					<span class="i1">Jerusalem with its most lofty point,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And night that opposite to him revolves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that the white and the vermilion cheeks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-551" id="noteref-551" epub:type="noteref">551</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By too great age were changing into orange.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We still were on the border of the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like people who are thinking of their road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who go in heart, and with the body stay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the gross vapors Mars grows fiery red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down in the West upon the ocean floor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appeared to me⁠—may I again behold it!⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A light along the sea so swiftly coming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From which when I a little had withdrawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then on each side of it appeared to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I knew not what of white, and underneath it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Little by little there came forth another.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Master yet had uttered not a word</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when he clearly recognized the pilot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He cried: “Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See how he scorneth human arguments,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-552" id="noteref-552" epub:type="noteref">552</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than his own wings, between so distant shores.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then as still nearer and more near us came</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that near by the eye could not endure him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But down I cast it; and he came to shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a small vessel, very swift and light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the water swallowed naught thereof.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beatitude seemed written in his face,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-553" id="noteref-553" epub:type="noteref">553</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more than a hundred spirits sat within.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">In exitu Israel de Ægypto!</i>”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They chanted all together in one voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With whatso in that psalm is after written.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he departed swiftly as he came.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The throng which still remained there unfamiliar</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one who in new matters makes essay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On every side was darting forth the day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-554" id="noteref-554" epub:type="noteref">554</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the new people lifted up their faces</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards us, saying to us: “If ye know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Show us the way to go unto the mountain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And answer made Virgilius: “Ye believe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But we are strangers even as yourselves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just now we came, a little while before you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another way, which was so rough and steep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Become aware that I was still alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pallid in their astonishment became;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as to messenger who bears the olive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The people throng to listen to the news,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So at the sight of me stood motionless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oblivious to go and make them fair.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One from among them saw I coming forward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to embrace me, with such great affection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it incited me to do the like.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O empty shadows, save in aspect only!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-555" id="noteref-555" epub:type="noteref">555</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As oft returned with them to my own breast!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think with wonder I depicted me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gently it said that I should stay my steps;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then knew I who it was, and I entreated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it would stop awhile to speak with me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It made reply to me: “Even as I loved thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In mortal body, so I love thee free;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My own Casella! to return once more<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-556" id="noteref-556" epub:type="noteref">556</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where I am, I make this journey,” said I;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“But how from thee has so much time be taken?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “No outrage has been done me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If he who takes both when and whom he pleases</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has many times denied to me this passage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of a righteous will his own is made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-557" id="noteref-557" epub:type="noteref">557</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoever wished to enter with all peace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-558" id="noteref-558" epub:type="noteref">558</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,</span>

					<span class="i1">Benignantly by him have been received.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-559" id="noteref-559" epub:type="noteref">559</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because for evermore assemble there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those who tow’rds Acheron do not descend.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “If some new law take not from thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Memory or practice of the song of love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which used to quiet in me all my longings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee may it please to comfort therewithal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hitherward coming is so much distressed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<em>Love, that within my mind discourses with me</em>,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forthwith began he so melodiously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The melody within me still is sounding.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Master, and myself, and all that people</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with him were, appeared as satisfied</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if naught else might touch the mind of any.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We all of us were moveless and attentive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exclaiming: “What is this, ye laggard spirits?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What negligence, what standing still is this?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That lets not God be manifest to you.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as when, collecting grain or tares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The doves, together at their pasture met,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If aught appear of which they are afraid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a sudden leave their food alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because they are assailed by greater care;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that fresh company did I behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The song relinquish, and go tow’rds the hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor was our own departure less in haste.</span>

					<span>Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had scattered them asunder o’er the plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how without him had I kept my course?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who would have led me up along the mountain?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He seemed to me within himself remorseful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O noble conscience, and without a stain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After his feet had laid aside the haste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which mars the dignity of every act,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let loose its faculties as if delighted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I my sight directed to the hill</span>

					<span class="i1">That highest tow’rds the heaven uplifts itself.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-560" id="noteref-560" epub:type="noteref">560</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was broken in front of me into the figure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto one side I turned me, with the fear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of being left alone, when I beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only in front of me the ground obscured.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why dost thou still mistrust?” my Comforter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began to say to me turned wholly round;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis evening there already where is buried</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The body within which I cast a shadow;</span>

					<span class="i1">’Tis from Brundusium ta’en, and Naples has it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-561" id="noteref-561" epub:type="noteref">561</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now if in front of me no shadow fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because one ray impedeth not another</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That how it works be not unveiled to us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Insane is he who hopeth that our reason</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can traverse the illimitable way,</span>

					<span class="i1">Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!</span>

					<span class="i1">No need there were for Mary to give birth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ye have seen desiring without fruit,</span>

					<span class="i1">Those whose desire would have been quieted,</span>

					<span class="i1">Which evermore is given them for a grief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many others”;⁠—and here bowed his head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more he said not, and remained disturbed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We came meanwhile unto the mountain’s foot;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There so precipitate we found the rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nimble legs would there have been in vain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twixt Lerici and Turbìa, the most desert,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-563" id="noteref-563" epub:type="noteref">563</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The most secluded pathway is a stair</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Easy and open, if compared with that.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Slopes down,” my Master said, his footsteps staying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“So that who goeth without wings may mount?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while he held his eyes upon the ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Examining the nature of the path,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I was looking up around the rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the left hand appeared to me a throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lift up thine eyes,” I to the Master said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou of thine own self can have it not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he looked at me, and with frank expression</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied: “Let us go there, for they come slowly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still was that people as far off from us,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-564" id="noteref-564" epub:type="noteref">564</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After a thousand steps of ours I say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As a good thrower with his hand would reach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they all crowded unto the hard masses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O happy dead! O spirits elect already!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virgilius made beginning, “by that peace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I believe is waiting for you all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the going up be possible,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to lose time irks him most who most knows.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what the foremost does the others do,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-565" id="noteref-565" epub:type="noteref">565</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So moving to approach us thereupon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Modest in face and dignified in gait.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as those in the advance saw broken</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The light upon the ground at my right side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that from me the shadow reached the rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the others, who came after them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Without your asking, I confess to you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This is a human body which you see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That not without a power which comes from Heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth he endeavor to surmount this wall.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Master thus; and said those worthy people:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Return ye then, and enter in before us,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making a signal with the back o’ the hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of them began: “Whoe’er thou art,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If e’er thou saw me in the other world.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I turned me tow’rds him, and looked at him closely;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When with humility I had disclaimed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’er having seen him, “Now behold!” he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And showed me high upon his breast a wound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said he with a smile: “I am Manfredi,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-566" id="noteref-566" epub:type="noteref">566</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The grandson of the Empress Costanza;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-567" id="noteref-567" epub:type="noteref">567</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-568" id="noteref-568" epub:type="noteref">568</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Sicily’s honor and of Aragon’s,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After I had my body lacerated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Horrible my iniquities had been;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it receives whatever turns to it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had but Cosenza’s pastor, who in chase<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-569" id="noteref-569" epub:type="noteref">569</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of me was sent by Clement at that time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In God read understandingly this page,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bones of my dead body still would be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-570" id="noteref-570" epub:type="noteref">570</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he transported them with tapers quenched.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-571" id="noteref-571" epub:type="noteref">571</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By malison of theirs is not so lost</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eternal Love, that it cannot return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So long as hope has anything of green.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True is it, who in contumacy dies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Holy Church, though penitent at last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Must wait upon the outside this bank</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thirty times told the time that he has been</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In his presumption, unless such decree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shorter by means of righteous prayers become.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See now if thou hast power to make me happy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By making known unto my good Costanza</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside,</span>

					<span class="i1">Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,</span>

					<span class="i1">With but a little forkful of his thorns</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mounts the summit of Bismantova,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the swift pinions and the plumes I say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of great desire, conducted after him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We mounted upward through the rifted rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on each side the border pressed upon us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And feet and hands the ground beneath required.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we were come upon the upper rim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the high bank, out on the open slope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“My Master,” said I, “what way shall we take?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-575" id="noteref-575" epub:type="noteref">575</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “No step of thine descend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still up the mount behind me win thy way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till some sage escort shall appear to us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The summit was so high it vanquished sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the hillside precipitous far more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spent with fatigue was I, when I began:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-576" id="noteref-576" epub:type="noteref">576</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which on that side encircles all the hill.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These words of his so spurred me on, that I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the circle was beneath my feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon ourselves we seated both of us</span>

					<span class="i1">Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>To the low shores mine eyes I first directed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That on the left hand we were smitten by it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Poet well perceived that I was wholly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bewildered at the chariot of the light,</span>

					<span class="i1">Where ’twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.</span>

					<span>Whereon he said to me: “If Castor and Pollux<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-577" id="noteref-577" epub:type="noteref">577</a></span>

					<span>How that may be wouldst thou have power to think,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Collected in thyself, imagine Zion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Together with this mount on earth to stand,</span>

					<span class="i1">Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou’lt see how of necessity must pass<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-580" id="noteref-580" epub:type="noteref">580</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This on one side, when that upon the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thine intelligence right clearly heed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Truly, my Master,” said I, “never yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saw I so clearly as I now discern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where my wit appeared incompetent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the mid-circle of supernal motion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in some art is the Equator called,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For reason which thou sayest, departeth hence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tow’rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-581" id="noteref-581" epub:type="noteref">581</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld it tow’rds the region of the heat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How far we have to go; for the hill rises</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “This mount is such, that ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the beginning down below ’tis tiresome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That going up shall be to thee as easy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As going down the current in a boat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then at this pathway’s ending thou wilt be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There to repose thy panting breath expect;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more I answer; and this I know for true.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he finished uttering these words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A voice close by us sounded: “Peradventure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At sound thereof each one of us turned round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw upon the left hand a great rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which neither I nor he before had noticed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thither we drew; and there were persons there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one through indolence is wont to stand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Holding his face low down between them bowed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O my sweet Lord,” I said, “do turn thine eye<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-582" id="noteref-582" epub:type="noteref">582</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On him who shows himself more negligent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than even if Sloth herself his sister were.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “Now go thou up, for thou art valiant.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then knew I who he was; and the distress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That still a little did my breathing quicken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My going to him hindered not; and after</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I came to him he hardly raised his head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “Hast thou seen clearly how the sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His sluggish attitude and his curt words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A little unto laughter moved my lips;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then I began: “Belacqua, I grieve not<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-583" id="noteref-583" epub:type="noteref">583</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In this place art thou? Waitest thou an escort?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “O brother, what’s the use of climbing?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since to my torment would not let me go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First heaven must needs so long revolve me round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Outside thereof, as in my life it did,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless, e’er that, some prayer may bring me aid<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-584" id="noteref-584" epub:type="noteref">584</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What profit others that in heaven are heard not?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saying: “Come now; see the sun has touched</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Meridian, and from the shore the night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Covers already with her foot Morocco.”</span>

					<span>I had already from those shades departed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-585" id="noteref-585" epub:type="noteref">585</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When from behind, pointing his finger at me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One shouted: “See, it seems as if shone not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sunshine on the left of him below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And like one living seems he to conduct him!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw them watching with astonishment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But me, but me, and the light which was broken!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Master said, “that thou thy pace dost slacken?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What matters it to thee what here is whispered?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come after me, and let the people talk;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its top for all the blowing of the winds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For evermore the man in whom is springing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because the force of one the other weakens.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What could I say in answer but “I come”?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said it somewhat with that color tinged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanwhile along the mountain-side across</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came people in advance of us a little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Singing the Miserere verse by verse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they became aware I gave no place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For passage of the sunshine through my body,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They changed their song into a long, hoarse “Oh!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And two of them, in form of messengers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Of your condition make us cognizant.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said my Master: “Ye can go your way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And carry back again to those who sent you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That this one’s body is of very flesh.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If they stood still because they saw his shadow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I suppose, enough is answered them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him let them honor, it may profit them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vapors enkindled saw I ne’er so swiftly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At early nightfall cleave the air serene,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-586" id="noteref-586" epub:type="noteref">586</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But upward they returned in briefer time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, on arriving, with the others wheeled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tow’rds us, like troops that run without a rein.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“This folk that presses unto us is great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cometh to implore thee,” said the Poet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“So still go onward, and in going listen.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O soul that goest to beatitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the same members wherewith thou wast born,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shouting they came, “a little stay thy steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look, if thou e’er hast any of us seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that o’er yonder thou bear news of him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ah, why dost thou go on? Ah, why not stay?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long since we all were slain by violence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sinners even to the latest hour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then did a light from heaven admonish us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From life we issued reconciled to God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “Although I gaze into your faces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No one I recognize; but if may please you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speak ye, and I will do it, by that peace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, following the feet of such a Guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From world to world makes itself sought by me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one began: “Each one has confidence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In thy good offices without an oath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-587" id="noteref-587" epub:type="noteref">587</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I, who speak alone before the others,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-588" id="noteref-588" epub:type="noteref">588</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ’twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I may purge away my grave offences.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-589" id="noteref-589" epub:type="noteref">589</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-590" id="noteref-590" epub:type="noteref">590</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There where I thought to be the most secure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twas he of Este had it done, who held me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hatred far beyond what justice willed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if towards the Mira I had fled,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-591" id="noteref-591" epub:type="noteref">591</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I was overtaken at Oriaco,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I still should be o’er yonder where men breathe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A lake made from my veins upon the ground.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said another: “Ah, be that desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou with pious pity aidest mine.</span>

					<span>I was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-592" id="noteref-592" epub:type="noteref">592</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hence among these I go with downcast front.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “What violence or what chance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-594" id="noteref-594" epub:type="noteref">594</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never has thy sepulture been known?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Oh,” he replied, “at Casentino’s foot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A river crosses named Archiano, born</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above the Hermitage in Apennine.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-595" id="noteref-595" epub:type="noteref">595</a></span>

					<span>There where the name thereof becometh void<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-596" id="noteref-596" epub:type="noteref">596</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There my sight lost I, and my utterance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">God’s Angel took me up, and he of hell<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-597" id="noteref-597" epub:type="noteref">597</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shouted: ‘O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou bearest away the eternal part of him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with the rest I’ll deal in other fashion!’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-598" id="noteref-598" epub:type="noteref">598</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That humid vapor which to water turns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-599" id="noteref-599" epub:type="noteref">599</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To intellect, and moved the mist and wind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By means of power, which his own nature gave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-600" id="noteref-600" epub:type="noteref">600</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With fog, and made the heaven above intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that the pregnant air to water changed;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-601" id="noteref-601" epub:type="noteref">601</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whate’er of it earth tolerated not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as it mingled with the mighty torrents,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards the royal river with such speed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My frozen body near unto its outlet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The robust Archian found, and into Arno</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-602" id="noteref-602" epub:type="noteref">602</a></span>

					<span>I made of me, when agony o’ercame me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom,</span>

					<span class="i1">Then with its booty covered and begirt me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rested thee from thy long journeying,”</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">Because the prayer from God was separate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Verily, in so deep a questioning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not decide, unless she tell it thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who light ’twixt truth and intellect shall be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know not if thou understand; I speak</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Beatrice; her shalt thou see above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smiling and happy, on this mountain’s top.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “Good Leader, let us make more haste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For I no longer tire me as before;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And see, e’en now the hill a shadow casts.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-613" id="noteref-613" epub:type="noteref">613</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“We will go forward with this day,” he answered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“As far as now is possible for us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But otherwise the fact is than thou thinkest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere thou art up there, thou shalt see return</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him, who now hides himself behind the hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that thou dost not interrupt his rays.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yonder there behold! a soul that stationed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All, all alone is looking hitherward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It will point out to us the quickest way.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We came up unto it; O Lombard soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How lofty and disdainful thou didst bear thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And grand and slow in moving of thine eyes!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing whatever did it say to us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But let us go our way, eying us only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After the manner of a couchant lion;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still near to it Virgilius drew, entreating</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it would point us out the best ascent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And it replied not unto his demand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of our native land and of our life</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It questioned us; and the sweet Guide began:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Mantua,”⁠—and the shade, all in itself recluse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rose tow’rds him from the place where first it was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “O Mantuan, I am Sordello<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-614" id="noteref-614" epub:type="noteref">614</a></span>

					<span class="i1">No Lady thou of Provinces, but brothel!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That noble soul was so impatient, only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the sweet sound of his own native land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make its citizen glad welcome there;</span>

					<span>After the gracious and glad salutations</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had three and four times been reiterated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sordello backward drew and said, “Who are you?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Or ever to this mountain were directed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The souls deserving to ascend to God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My bones were buried by Octavian.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-627" id="noteref-627" epub:type="noteref">627</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am Virgilius; and for no crime else</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did I lose heaven, than for not having faith”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In this wise then my Leader made reply.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As one who suddenly before him sees</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Something whereat he marvels, who believes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yet does not, saying, “It is! it is not!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he appeared; and then bowed down his brow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with humility returned towards him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, where inferiors embrace, embraced him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O glory of the Latians, thou,” he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Through whom our language showed what it could do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O pride eternal of the place I came from,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What merit or what grace to me reveals thee?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I to hear thy words be worthy, tell me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou dost come from Hell, and from what cloister.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Through all the circles of the doleful realm,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Responded he, “have I come hitherward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Heaven’s power impelled me, and with that I come.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I by not doing, not by doing, lost</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sight of that high sun which thou desirest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And which too late by me was recognized.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A place there is below not sad with torments,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-628" id="noteref-628" epub:type="noteref">628</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But darkness only, where the lamentations</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have not the sound of wailing, but are sighs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There dwell I with the little innocents</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Snatched by the teeth of Death, or ever they</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were from our human sinfulness exempt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There dwell I among those who the three saintly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-629" id="noteref-629" epub:type="noteref">629</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virtues did not put on, and without vice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The others knew and followed all of them.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-630" id="noteref-630" epub:type="noteref">630</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if thou know and can, some indication</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give us by which we may the sooner come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where Purgatory has its right beginning.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He answered: “No fixed place has been assigned us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis lawful for me to go up and round;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So far as I can go, as guide I join thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But see already how the day declines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to go up by night we are not able;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-631" id="noteref-631" epub:type="noteref">631</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore ’tis well to think of some fair sojourn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Souls are there on the right hand here withdrawn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou permit me I will lead thee to them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou shalt know them not without delight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“How is this?” was the answer; “should one wish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To mount by night would he prevented be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By others? or mayhap would not have power?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the ground the good Sordello drew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His finger, saying, “See, this line alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not that aught else would hindrance give, however,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To going up, save the nocturnal darkness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This with the want of power the will perplexes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We might indeed therewith return below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, wandering, walk the hill-side round about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While the horizon holds the day imprisoned.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon my Lord, as if in wonder, said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Do thou conduct us thither, where thou sayest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That we can take delight in tarrying.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Little had we withdrawn us from that place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I perceived the mount was hollowed out</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thitherward,” said that shade, “will we repair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where of itself the hill-side makes a lap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there for the new day will we await.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twixt hill and plain there was a winding path<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-632" id="noteref-632" epub:type="noteref">632</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which led us to the margin of that dell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where dies the border more than half away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gold and fine silver, and scarlet and pearl-white,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-633" id="noteref-633" epub:type="noteref">633</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Indian wood resplendent and serene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fresh emerald the moment it is broken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By herbage and by flowers within that hollow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Planted, each one in color would be vanquished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As by its greater vanquished is the less.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor in that place had nature painted only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of the sweetness of a thousand odors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made there a mingled fragrance and unknown.</span>

					<span class="i1">There seated, singing, spirits I beheld,</span>

					<span class="i1">Which were not visible outside the valley.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Before the scanty sun now seeks his nest,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began the Mantuan who had led us thither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Among them do not wish me to conduct you.</span>

					<span>’Twas now the hour that turneth back desire<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-652" id="noteref-652" epub:type="noteref">652</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In those who sail the sea, and melts the heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The day they’ve said to their sweet friends farewell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the new pilgrim penetrates with love,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-653" id="noteref-653" epub:type="noteref">653</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If he doth hear from far away a bell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seemeth to deplore the dying day,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-654" id="noteref-654" epub:type="noteref">654</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I began to make of no avail</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My hearing, and to watch one of the souls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uprisen, that begged attention with its hand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It joined and lifted upward both its palms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fixing its eyes upon the orient,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if it said to God, “Naught else I care for.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">Te lucis ante</i>” so devoutly issued<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-655" id="noteref-655" epub:type="noteref">655</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth from its mouth, and with such dulcet notes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It made me issue forth from my own mind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then the others, sweetly and devoutly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accompanied it through all the hymn entire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having their eyes on the supernal wheels.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here, Reader, fix thine eyes well on the truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For now indeed so subtle is the veil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Surely to penetrate within is easy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw that army of the gentle-born</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereafterward in silence upward gaze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if in expectation, pale and humble;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from on high come forth and down descend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw two Angels with two flaming swords,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-656" id="noteref-656" epub:type="noteref">656</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Truncated and deprived of their points.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-657" id="noteref-657" epub:type="noteref">657</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Green as the little leaflets just now born<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-658" id="noteref-658" epub:type="noteref">658</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One just above us came to take his station,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one descended to the opposite bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the people were contained between them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clearly in them discerned I the blond head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in their faces was the eye bewildered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As faculty confounded by excess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“From Mary’s bosom both of them have come,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sordello said, “as guardians of the valley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the serpent, that will come anon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereupon I, who knew not by what road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned round about, and closely drew myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And once again Sordello: “Now descend we</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right pleasant will it be for them to see you.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only three steps I think that I descended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And was below, and saw one who was looking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only at me, as if he fain would know me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already now the air was growing dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not so that between his eyes and mine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-659" id="noteref-659" epub:type="noteref">659</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It did not show what it before locked up.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tow’rds me he moved, and I tow’rds him did move;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-660" id="noteref-660" epub:type="noteref">660</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I beheld thee not among the damned!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No greeting fair was left unsaid between us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then asked he: “How long is it since thou camest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er the far waters to the mountain’s foot?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Oh!” said I to him, “through the dismal places</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I came this morn; and am in the first life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Albeit the other, going thus, I gain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the instant my reply was heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He and Sordello both shrank back from me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like people who are suddenly bewildered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One to Virgilius, and the other turned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To one who sat there, crying, “Up, Currado!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come and behold what God in grace has willed!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, turned to me: “By that especial grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-661" id="noteref-661" epub:type="noteref">661</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where answer to the innocent is made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think her mother loves me more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since she has laid aside her wimple white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-662" id="noteref-662" epub:type="noteref">662</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through her full easily is comprehended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How long in woman lasts the fire of love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If eye or touch do not relight it often.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fair a hatchment will not make for her<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-663" id="noteref-663" epub:type="noteref">663</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Viper marshalling the Milanese<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-664" id="noteref-664" epub:type="noteref">664</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A-field, as would have made Gallura’s Cock.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-665" id="noteref-665" epub:type="noteref">665</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which measurably burneth in the heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still to that point where slowest are the stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my Conductor: “Son, what dost thou gaze at</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up there?” And I to him: “At those three torches<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-666" id="noteref-666" epub:type="noteref">666</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which this hither pole is all on fire.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “The four resplendent stars</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And these have mounted up to where those were.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he was speaking, to himself Sordello</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew him, and said, “Lo there our Adversary!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pointed with his finger to look thither.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the side on which the little valley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-667" id="noteref-667" epub:type="noteref">667</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turning at times its head about, and licking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I did not see, and therefore cannot say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How the celestial falcons ’gan to move,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But well I saw that they were both in motion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up to their stations flying back alike.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shade that to the Judge had near approached</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he had called, throughout that whole assault</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“So may the light that leadeth thee on high</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Find in thine own free-will as much of wax</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As needful is up to the highest azure,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-668" id="noteref-668" epub:type="noteref">668</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Began it, “if some true intelligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Valdimagra or its neighborhood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-669" id="noteref-669" epub:type="noteref">669</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou knowest, tell it me, who once was great there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Currado Malaspina was I called;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-670" id="noteref-670" epub:type="noteref">670</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I’m not the elder, but from him descended;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To mine I bore the love which here refineth.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O,” said I unto him, “through your domains</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I never passed, but where is there a dwelling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throughout all Europe, where they are not known?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That fame, which doeth honor to your house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he knows of them who ne’er was there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as I hope for heaven, I swear to you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your honored family in naught abates</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The glory of the purse and of the sword.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is so privileged by use and nature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That though a guilty head misguide the world,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-671" id="noteref-671" epub:type="noteref">671</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “Now go; for the sun shall not lie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-672" id="noteref-672" epub:type="noteref">672</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all his four feet covers and bestrides,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before that such a courteous opinion</span>

					<span class="i1">Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-673" id="noteref-673" epub:type="noteref">673</a></span>

					<span class="i1">With greater nails than of another’s speech,</span>

					<span class="i1">Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-676" id="noteref-676" epub:type="noteref">676</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With gems her forehead all relucent was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Set in the shape of that cold animal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-677" id="noteref-677" epub:type="noteref">677</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now the third was bending down its wings;</span>

					<span>When I, who something had of Adam in me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-679" id="noteref-679" epub:type="noteref">679</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There were all five of us already sat.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-680" id="noteref-680" epub:type="noteref">680</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just at the hour when her sad lay begins</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The little swallow, near unto the morning,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-681" id="noteref-681" epub:type="noteref">681</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance in memory of her former woes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the mind of man, a wanderer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Almost prophetic in its visions is,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-682" id="noteref-682" epub:type="noteref">682</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this, it seemed to me, was where had been<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-683" id="noteref-683" epub:type="noteref">683</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When to the high consistory he was rapt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thought within myself, perchance he strikes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From habit only here, and from elsewhere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disdains to bear up any in his feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Terrible as the lightning he descended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And snatched me upward even to the fire.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-684" id="noteref-684" epub:type="noteref">684</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therein it seemed that he and I were burning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the imagined fire did scorch me so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of necessity my sleep was broken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not otherwise Achilles started up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Around him turning his awakened eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And knowing not the place in which he was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What time from Chiron stealthily his mother<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-685" id="noteref-685" epub:type="noteref">685</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than I upstarted, when from off my face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As doth the man who freezes with affright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only my Comforter was at my side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now the sun was more than two hours high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Be not intimidated,” said my Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Be reassured, for all is well with us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">See there the cliff that closes it around;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When inwardly thy spirit was asleep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-686" id="noteref-686" epub:type="noteref">686</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the flowers that deck the land below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There came a Lady and said: ‘I am Lucìa;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-687" id="noteref-687" epub:type="noteref">687</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let me take this one up, who is asleep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So will I make his journey easier for him.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sordello and the other noble shapes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-688" id="noteref-688" epub:type="noteref">688</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That open entrance pointed out to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then she and sleep together went away.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-689" id="noteref-689" epub:type="noteref">689</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In guise of one whose doubts are reassured,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who to confidence his fear doth change,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After the truth has been discovered to him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did I change; and when without disquiet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Leader saw me, up along the cliff</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He moved, and I behind him, tow’rd the height.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reader, thou seest well how I exalt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My theme, and therefore if with greater art</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I fortify it, marvel not thereat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nearer approached we, and were in such place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That there, where first appeared to me a rift</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Diverse in color, to go up to it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as I opened more and more mine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw him seated on the highest stair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such in the face that I endured it not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his hand he had a naked sword,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow’rds us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Tell it from where you are, what is’t you wish?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began he to exclaim; “where is the escort?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take heed your coming hither harm you not!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Master answered him, “but even now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said to us, ‘Thither go; there is the portal.’ ”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And may she speed your footsteps in all good,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Again began the courteous janitor;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Come forward then unto these stairs of ours.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thither did we approach; and the first stair<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-690" id="noteref-690" epub:type="noteref">690</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I mirrored myself therein as I appear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-691" id="noteref-691" epub:type="noteref">691</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was of a calcined and uneven stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The third, that uppermost rests massively,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of his feet was holding upon this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-692" id="noteref-692" epub:type="noteref">692</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the three stairs upward with good will</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did my Conductor draw me, saying: “Ask</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Humbly that he the fastening may undo.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For mercy’s sake besought that he would open,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But first upon my breast three times I smote.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seven P’s upon my forehead he described<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-693" id="noteref-693" epub:type="noteref">693</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the sword’s point, and, “Take heed that thou wash</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These wounds, when thou shalt be within,” he said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the same color were with his attire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One was of gold, and the other was of silver;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-694" id="noteref-694" epub:type="noteref">694</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First with the white, and after with the yellow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Plied he the door, so that I was content.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Whenever faileth either of these keys</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it turn not rightly in the lock,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said to us, “this entrance doth not open.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More precious one is, but the other needs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More art and intellect ere it unlock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For it is that which doth the knot unloose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Peter I have them; and he bade me err</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rather in opening than in keeping shut,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If people but fall down before my feet.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then pushed the portals of the sacred door,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exclaiming: “Enter; but I give you warning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That forth returns whoever looks behind.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-695" id="noteref-695" epub:type="noteref">695</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when upon their hinges were turned round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The swivels of that consecrated gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-696" id="noteref-696" epub:type="noteref">696</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tarpeia, when was ta’en from it the good</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-697" id="noteref-697" epub:type="noteref">697</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And “<i xml:lang="la">Te Deum laudamus</i>” seemed to hear<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-698" id="noteref-698" epub:type="noteref">698</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In voices mingled with sweet melody.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exactly such an image rendered me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When people singing with the organ stand;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-699" id="noteref-699" epub:type="noteref">699</a></span>

					<span>When we had crossed the threshold of the door<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-700" id="noteref-700" epub:type="noteref">700</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the perverted love of souls disuses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because it makes the crooked way seem straight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Re-echoing I heard it closed again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What for my failing had been fit excuse?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We mounted upward through a rifted rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which undulated to this side and that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a wave receding and advancing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Here it behoves us use a little art,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began my Leader, “to adapt ourselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now here, now there, to the receding side.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this our footsteps so infrequent made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sooner had the moon’s decreasing disk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-701" id="noteref-701" epub:type="noteref">701</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Regained its bed to sink again to rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than we were forth from out that needle’s eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when we free and in the open were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the mountain backward piles itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wearied out, and both of us uncertain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About our way, we stopped upon a plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More desolate than roads across the deserts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From where its margin borders on the void,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To foot of the high bank that ever rises,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A human body three times told would measure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And far as eye of mine could wing its flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now on the left, and on the right flank now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The same this cornice did appear to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I perceived the embankment round about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which all right of ascent had interdicted,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-702" id="noteref-702" epub:type="noteref">702</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be of marble white, and so adorned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-703" id="noteref-703" epub:type="noteref">703</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Nature’s self, had there been put to shame.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-704" id="noteref-704" epub:type="noteref">704</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Angel, who came down to earth with tidings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And opened Heaven from its long interdict,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In front of us appeared so truthfully</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There sculptured in a gracious attitude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He did not seem an image that is silent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One would have sworn that he was saying, “Ave”;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-705" id="noteref-705" epub:type="noteref">705</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For she was there in effigy portrayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in her mien this language had impressed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Ecce ancilla Dei</i>,” as distinctly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-706" id="noteref-706" epub:type="noteref">706</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As any figure stamps itself in wax.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The gentle Master said, who had me standing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon that side where people have their hearts;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In rear of Mary, and upon that side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he was standing who conducted me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another story on the rock imposed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that before mine eyes it might be set.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There sculptured in the self-same marble were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-707" id="noteref-707" epub:type="noteref">707</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>People appeared in front, and all of them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In seven choirs divided, of two senses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made one say, “No,” the other, “Yes, they sing.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were in the yes and no discordant made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Preceded there the vessel benedight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-708" id="noteref-708" epub:type="noteref">708</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more and less than King was he in this.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Opposite, represented at the window</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-709" id="noteref-709" epub:type="noteref">709</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I moved my feet from where I had been standing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To examine near at hand another story,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span id="purgatorio-canto-10-line-73">There the high glory of the Roman Prince<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-710" id="noteref-710" epub:type="noteref">710</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was chronicled, whose great beneficence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moved Gregory to his great victory;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-711" id="noteref-711" epub:type="noteref">711</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And a poor widow at his bridle stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In attitude of weeping and of grief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around about him seemed it thronged and full</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above them visibly in the wind were moving.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wretched woman in the midst of these</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed to be saying: “Give me vengeance, Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to answer her: “Now wait until</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I shall return.” And she: “My Lord,” like one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In whom grief is impatient, “shouldst thou not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Return?” And he: “Who shall be where I am</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will give it thee.” And she: “Good deed of others</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he: “Now comfort thee, for it behoves me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I discharge my duty ere I move;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who on no new thing has ever looked</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was the creator of this visible language,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Novel to us, for here it is not found.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While I delighted me in contemplating</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The images of such humility,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dear to look on for their Maker’s sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Behold, upon this side, but rare they make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their steps,” the Poet murmured, “many people;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These will direct us to the lofty stairs.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine eyes, that in beholding were intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see new things, of which they curious are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In turning round towards him were not slow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From thy good purposes, because thou hearest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Attend not to the fashion of the torment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Think of what follows; think that at the worst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Master,” began I, “that which I behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moving towards us seems to me not persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what I know not, so in sight I waver.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “The grievous quality</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of this their torment bows them so to earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That my own eyes at first contended with it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But look there fixedly, and disentangle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By sight what cometh underneath those stones;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already canst thou see how each is stricken.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, in the vision of the mind infirm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Confidence have in your backsliding steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do ye not comprehend that we are worms,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-712" id="noteref-712" epub:type="noteref">712</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly</span>

					<span>Why floats aloft your spirit high in air?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-713" id="noteref-713" epub:type="noteref">713</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like are ye unto insects undeveloped,</span>

					<span class="i1">Even as the worm in whom formation fails!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to sustain a ceiling or a roof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In place of corbel, oftentimes a figure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is seen to join its knees unto its breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which makes of the unreal real anguish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Arise in him who sees it; fashioned thus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld I those, when I had ta’en good heed.</span>

					<span>True is it, they were more or less bent down,</span>

					<span class="i1">According as they more or less were laden;</span>

					<span class="i1">And he who had most patience in his looks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping did seem to say, “I can no more!”</span>

					<span class="i1">Has with it dragged into adversity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And here must I this burden bear for it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till God be satisfied, since I did not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the living, here among the dead.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Listening I downward bent my countenance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one of them, not this one who was speaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And looked at me, and knew me, and called out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Keeping his eyes laboriously fixed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On me, who all bowed down was going with them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O,” asked I him, “art thou not Oderisi,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-718" id="noteref-718" epub:type="noteref">718</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Agobbio’s honor, and honor of that art</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“Brother,” said he, “more laughing are the leaves</span>

					<span class="i1">Touched by the brush of Franco Bolognese;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-720" id="noteref-720" epub:type="noteref">720</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All his the honor now, and mine in part.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In sooth I had not been so courteous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While I was living, for the great desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of excellence, on which my heart was bent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here of such pride is paid the forfeiture;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yet I should not be here, were it not</span>

					<span class="i1">That, having power to sin, I turned to God.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O thou vain glory of the human powers,</span>

					<span class="i1">How little green upon thy summit lingers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If’t be not followed by an age of grossness!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In painting Cimabue thought that he<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-721" id="noteref-721" epub:type="noteref">721</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should hold the field, now Giotto has the cry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-722" id="noteref-722" epub:type="noteref">722</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the other’s fame is growing dim.</span>

					<span>So has one Guido from the other taken<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-723" id="noteref-723" epub:type="noteref">723</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The glory of our tongue, and he perchance</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Naught is this mundane rumor but a breath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of wind, that comes now this way and now that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And changes name, because it changes side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What fame shalt thou have more, if old peel off<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-725" id="noteref-725" epub:type="noteref">725</a></span>

					<span class="i1">From thee thy flesh, than if thou hadst been dead</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Ere pass a thousand years? which is a shorter</span>

					<br/>
					<span>With him, who takes so little of the road<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-728" id="noteref-728" epub:type="noteref">728</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In front of me, all Tuscany resounded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where he was lord, what time was overthrown<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-729" id="noteref-729" epub:type="noteref">729</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Florentine delirium, that superb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was at that day as now ’tis prostitute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your reputation is the color of grass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which comes and goes, and that discolors it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which it issues green from out the earth.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “Thy true speech fills my heart with good<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-730" id="noteref-730" epub:type="noteref">730</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Humility, and great tumor thou assuagest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That,” he replied, “is Provenzan Salvani,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-731" id="noteref-731" epub:type="noteref">731</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he is here because he had presumed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bring Siena all into his hands.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He has gone thus, and goeth without rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’er since he died; such money renders back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In payment he who is on earth too daring.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “If every spirit who awaits</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The verge of life before that he repent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remains below there and ascends not hither,</span>

					<span>(Unless good orison shall him bestead,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until as much time as he lived be passed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How was the coming granted him in largess?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“When he in greatest splendor lived,” said he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Freely upon the Campo of Siena,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All shame being laid aside, he placed himself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there to draw his friend from the duress</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>I say no more, and know that I speak darkly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbors</span>

					<span class="i1">Already showed how light of foot we were,</span>

					<span class="i1">In point of artifice, with figures covered</span>

					<span class="i1">Whate’er as pathway from the mount projects.</span>

					<span class="i1">More than all other creatures, down from heaven</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Celestial, lying on the other side,</span>

					<span class="i1">Still clad in armour round about their father,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if bewildered, looking at the people</span>

					<span class="i1">“Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!”</span>

					<span>Who e’er of pencil master was or stile,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>More of the mount by us was now encompassed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And far more spent the circuit of the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he, who ever watchful in advance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was going on, began: “Lift up thy head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis no more time to go thus meditating.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo there an Angel who is making haste</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">From service of the day the sixth handmaiden.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-755" id="noteref-755" epub:type="noteref">755</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With reverence thine acts and looks adorn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he may delight to speed us upward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Think that this day will never dawn again.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was familiar with his admonition</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ever to lose no time; so on this theme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He could not unto me speak covertly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Towards us came the being beautiful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vested in white, and in his countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as appears the tremulous morning star.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Come,” said he, “near at hand here are the steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And easy from henceforth is the ascent.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At this announcement few are they who come!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O human creatures, born to soar aloft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why fall ye thus before a little wind?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He led us on to where the rock was cleft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There smote upon my forehead with his wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then a safe passage promised unto me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As on the right hand, to ascend the mount</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where seated is the church that lordeth it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-756" id="noteref-756" epub:type="noteref">756</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By stairways that were made there in the age</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When still were safe the ledger and the stave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-757" id="noteref-757" epub:type="noteref">757</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en thus attempered is the bank which falls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sheer downward from the second circle there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But on this side and that the high rock grazes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As we were turning thitherward our persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Beati pauperes spiritu</i>,” voices<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-758" id="noteref-758" epub:type="noteref">758</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah me! how different are these entrances</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the Infernal! for with anthems here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One enters, and below with wild laments.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We now were mounting up the sacred stairs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And it appeared to me by far more easy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than on the plain it had appeared before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I: “My Master, say, what heavy thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He answered: “When the P’s which have remained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still on thy face almost obliterate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But urging up will be to them delight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then did I even as they do who are going</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With something on the head to them unknown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless the signs of others make them doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with the fingers of the right hand spread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I found but six the letters, that had carved</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon my temples he who bore the keys;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.</span>

					<span class="i1">So much already there had we advanced</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In little time, by dint of ready will;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tow’rds us there were heard to fly, albeit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They were not visible, spirits uttering</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto Love’s table courteous invitations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first voice that passed onward in its flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Vinum non habent</i>,” said in accents loud,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-763" id="noteref-763" epub:type="noteref">763</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And went reiterating it behind us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ere it wholly grew inaudible</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because of distance, passed another, crying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“I am Orestes!” and it also stayed not.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-764" id="noteref-764" epub:type="noteref">764</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O,” said I, “Father, these, what voices are they?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And even as I asked, behold the third,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “Love those from whom ye have had evil!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-765" id="noteref-765" epub:type="noteref">765</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the good Master said: “This circle scourges</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sin of envy, and on that account</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-766" id="noteref-766" epub:type="noteref">766</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bridle of another sound shall be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-767" id="noteref-767" epub:type="noteref">767</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And people thou wilt see before us sitting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And each one close against the cliff is seated.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not from the color of the stone diverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when we were a little farther onward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I heard a cry of, “Mary, pray for us!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A cry of, “Michael, Peter, and all Saints!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-768" id="noteref-768" epub:type="noteref">768</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think there walketh still on earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A man so hard, that he would not be pierced</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With pity at what afterward I saw.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when I had approached so near to them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That manifest to me their acts became,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one sustained the other with his shoulder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all of them were by the bank sustained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one upon another leans his head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that in others pity soon may rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not only at the accent of their words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But at their aspect, which no less implores.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as unto the blind the sun comes not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Heaven’s light will not be bounteous of itself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is done, because it will not quiet stay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing the others without being seen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therefore waited not for my demand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But said: “Speak, and be brief, and to the point.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had Virgilius upon that side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the embankment from which one may fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since by no border ’tis engarlanded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the other side of me I had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The shades devout, who through the horrible seam</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To them I turned me, and, “O people, certain,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began I, “of beholding the high light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which your desire has solely in its care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So may grace speedily dissolve the scum</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon your consciences, that limpidly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through them descend the river of the mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me, for dear ’twill be to me and gracious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If any soul among you here is Latian,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-769" id="noteref-769" epub:type="noteref">769</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ’twill perchance be good for him I learn it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O brother mine, each one is citizen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of one true city; but thy meaning is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By way of answer this I seemed to hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A little farther on than where I stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the rest I saw a shade that waited</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In aspect, and should anyone ask how,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Spirit,” I said, “who stoopest to ascend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou art he who did reply to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make thyself known to me by place or name.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sienese was I,” it replied, “and with</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The others here recleanse my guilty life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sapient I was not, although I Sapia<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-770" id="noteref-770" epub:type="noteref">770</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was called, and I was at another’s harm<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-771" id="noteref-771" epub:type="noteref">771</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More happy far than at my own good fortune.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The arc already of my years descending,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-772" id="noteref-772" epub:type="noteref">772</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My fellow-citizens near unto Colle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were joined in battle with their adversaries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I was praying God for what he willed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Routed were they, and turned into the bitter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A joy received unequalled by all others;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that I lifted upward my bold face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying to God, ‘Henceforth I fear thee not,’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-773" id="noteref-773" epub:type="noteref">773</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Peace I desired with God at the extreme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of my existence, and as yet would not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My debt have been by penitence discharged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had it not been that in remembrance held me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-774" id="noteref-774" epub:type="noteref">774</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who out of charity was grieved for me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But who art thou, that into our conditions</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Mine eyes,” I said, “will yet be here ta’en from me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But for short space; for small is the offence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Committed by their being turned with envy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My soul is, of the torment underneath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For even now the load down there weighs on me.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-775" id="noteref-775" epub:type="noteref">775</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she to me: “Who led thee, then, among us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I: “He who is with me, and speaks not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And living am I; therefore ask of me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-776" id="noteref-776" epub:type="noteref">776</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O, this is such a novel thing to hear,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She answered, “that great sign it is God loves thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I implore, by what thou most desirest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If e’er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-778" id="noteref-778" epub:type="noteref">778</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More hope than in discovering the Diana;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-779" id="noteref-779" epub:type="noteref">779</a></span>
					<br/>

					<span>“Who is this one that goes about our mountain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-781" id="noteref-781" epub:type="noteref">781</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever Death has given him power of flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I know not who, but know he’s not alone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gently, so that he may speak, accost him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did two spirits, leaning tow’rds each other,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-782" id="noteref-782" epub:type="noteref">782</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Discourse about me there on the right hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then held supine their faces to address me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said the one: “O soul, that, fastened still</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the body, tow’rds the heaven art going,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For charity console us, and declare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence comest and who art thou; for thou mak’st us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much to marvel at this grace of thine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As must a thing that never yet has been.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “Through midst of Tuscany there wanders</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A streamlet that is born in Falterona,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-783" id="noteref-783" epub:type="noteref">783</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From thereupon do I this body bring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To tell you who I am were speech in vain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because my name as yet makes no great noise.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If well thy meaning I can penetrate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With intellect of mine,” then answered me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He who first spake, “thou speakest of the Arno.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said the other to him: “Why concealed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This one the appellation of that river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a man doth of things horrible?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus the shade that questioned was of this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himself acquitted: “I know not; but truly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-784" id="noteref-784" epub:type="noteref">784</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in few places it that mark surpasses)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To where it yields itself in restoration</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Virtue is like an enemy avoided</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which account have so transformed their nature<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-785" id="noteref-785" epub:type="noteref">785</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dwellers in that miserable valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-786" id="noteref-786" epub:type="noteref">786</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Than other food for human use created,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It first directeth its impoverished way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Curs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-787" id="noteref-787" epub:type="noteref">787</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More snarling than their puissance demands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It goes on falling, and the more it grows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-788" id="noteref-788" epub:type="noteref">788</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This maledict and misadventurous ditch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Descended then through many a hollow gulf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-789" id="noteref-789" epub:type="noteref">789</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They fear no cunning that may master them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor will I cease because another hears me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And well ’twill be for him, if still he mind him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-790" id="noteref-790" epub:type="noteref">790</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy grandson I behold, who doth become<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-791" id="noteref-791" epub:type="noteref">791</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A hunter of those wolves upon the bank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sells their flesh, it being yet alive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-792" id="noteref-792" epub:type="noteref">792</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He leaves it such, a thousand years from now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In its primeval state ’tis not re-wooded.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As at the announcement of impending ills</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The face of him who listens is disturbed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From whate’er side the peril seize upon him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I beheld that other soul, which stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When it had gathered to itself the word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The speech of one and aspect of the other</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had me desirous made to know their names,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat the spirit which first spake to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began again: “Thou wishest I should bring me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To do for thee what thou’lt not do for me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since God willeth that in thee shine forth</span>

					<span class="i1">Such grace of his, I’ll not be chary with thee;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>My blood was so with envy set on fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That if I had beheld a man make merry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o’er with pallor.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy name is, since no longer is awaited</span>

					<span>But go now, Tuscan, for it now delights me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weep far better than it does to speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much has our discourse my mind distressed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We were aware that those beloved souls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Heard us depart; therefore, by keeping silent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They made us of our pathway confident.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we became alone by going onward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thunder, when it doth cleave the air, appeared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A voice, that counter to us came, exclaiming:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-810" id="noteref-810" epub:type="noteref">810</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Shall slay me whosoever findeth me!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-811" id="noteref-811" epub:type="noteref">811</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fled as the reverberation dies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as hearing had a truce from this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold another, with so great a crash,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it resembled thunderings following fast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-812" id="noteref-812" epub:type="noteref">812</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then, to press myself close to the Poet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I backward, and not forward, took a step.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already on all sides the air was quiet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said he to me: “That was the hard curb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ought to hold a man within his bounds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But you take in the bait so that the hook</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1" id="purgatorio-canto-14-line-147">And hence availeth little curb or call.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-813" id="noteref-813" epub:type="noteref">813</a></span>

					<span>As much as ’twixt the close of the third hour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-816" id="noteref-816" epub:type="noteref">816</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which aye in fashion of a child is playing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So much it now appeared, towards the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was of his course remaining to the sun;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There it was evening, and ’twas midnight here;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the rays smote the middle of our faces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because by us the mount was so encircled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That straight towards the west we now were going;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I perceived my forehead overpowered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the splendor far more than at first,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stupor were to me the things unknown;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat towards the summit of my brow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I raised my hands, and made myself the visor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the excessive glare diminishes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As when from off the water, or a mirror,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ascending upward in the selfsame measure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it descends, and deviates as far</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From falling of a stone in line direct,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-817" id="noteref-817" epub:type="noteref">817</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(As demonstrate experiment and art,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So it appeared to me that by a light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Refracted there before me I was smitten;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which account my sight was swift to flee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So fully screen my sight that it avail me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said I, “and seems towards us to be moving?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The family of heaven,” he answered me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“An angel ’tis, who comes to invite us upward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon will it be, that to behold these things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much as nature fashioned thee to feel.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we had reached the Angel benedight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With joyful voice he said: “Here enter in</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To stairway far less steep than are the others.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We mounting were, already thence departed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And “<i xml:lang="la">Beati misericordes</i>” was<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-818" id="noteref-818" epub:type="noteref">818</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind us sung, “Rejoice, thou that o’ercomest!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-819" id="noteref-819" epub:type="noteref">819</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Master and myself, we two alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were going upward, and I thought, in going,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some profit to acquire from words of his;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him directed me, thus asking:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What did the spirit of Romagna mean,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1" id="purgatorio-canto-15-line-45">Mentioning interdict and partnership?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he to me: “Of his own greatest failing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If he reprove us, that we less may rue it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because are thither pointed your desires</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where by companionship each share is lessened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if the love of the supernal sphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should upwardly direct your aspiration,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There would not be that fear within your breast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For there, as much the more as one says <em>Our</em>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-820" id="noteref-820" epub:type="noteref">820</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much the more of good each one possesses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more of charity in that cloister burns.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I am more hungering to be satisfied,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said, “than if I had before been silent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more of doubt within my mind I gather.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How can it be, that boon distributed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more possessors can more wealthy make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therein, than if by few it be possessed?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Because thou fixest still</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That goodness infinite and ineffable<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-821" id="noteref-821" epub:type="noteref">821</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is above there, runneth unto love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So much it gives itself as it finds ardor,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-822" id="noteref-822" epub:type="noteref">822</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that as far as charity extends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er it increases the eternal valor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the more people thitherward aspire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More are there to love well, and more they love there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if my reasoning appease thee not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take from thee this and every other longing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Endeavour, then, that soon may be extinct,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-823" id="noteref-823" epub:type="noteref">823</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As are the two already, the five wounds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That close themselves again by being painful.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as I wished to say, “Thou dost appease me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw that I had reached another circle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There it appeared to me that in a vision</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in a temple many persons saw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the door a woman, with the sweet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behavior of a mother, saying: “Son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were seeking for thee”;⁠—and as here she ceased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which appeared at first had disappeared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I beheld another with those waters</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From great disdain of others it is born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saying: “If of that city thou art lord,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-824" id="noteref-824" epub:type="noteref">824</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For whose name was such strife among the gods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whence doth every science scintillate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Avenge thyself on those audacious arms</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus”;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-825" id="noteref-825" epub:type="noteref">825</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the lord seemed to me benign and mild</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To answer her with aspect temperate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What shall we do to those who wish us ill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If he who loves us be by us condemned?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-826" id="noteref-826" epub:type="noteref">826</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With stones a young man slaying, clamorously</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still crying to each other, “Kill him! kill him!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him I saw bow down, because of death</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That weighed already on him, to the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he would pardon those his persecutors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as my soul had outwardly returned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To things external to it which are true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did I my not false errors recognize.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-827" id="noteref-827" epub:type="noteref">827</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Leader, who could see me bear myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exclaimed: “What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But hast been coming more than half a league</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I’ll tell thee,” said I, “what appeared to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When thus from me my legs were ta’en away.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “If thou shouldst have a hundred masks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon thy face, from me would not be shut</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy cogitations, howsoever small.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I did not ask, ‘What ails thee?’ as he does</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who only looketh with the eyes that see not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When of the soul bereft the body lies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But asked it to give vigor to thy feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To use their wakefulness when it returns.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We passed along, athwart the twilight peering</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forward as far as ever eye could stretch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In our direction, sombre as the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor was there place to hide one’s self therefrom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.</span>

					<span>Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-828" id="noteref-828" epub:type="noteref">828</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Of every planet under a poor sky,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-829" id="noteref-829" epub:type="noteref">829</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much as may be tenebrous with cloud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne’er made unto my sight so thick a veil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As did that smoke which there enveloped us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For not an eye it suffered to stay open;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en as a blind man goes behind his guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lest he should wander, or should strike against</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So went I through the bitter and foul air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Listening unto my Leader, who said only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Look that from me thou be not separated.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Voices I heard, and everyone appeared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To supplicate for peace and misericord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Lamb of God who takes away our sins.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still “<i xml:lang="la">Agnus Dei</i>” their exordium was;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-830" id="noteref-830" epub:type="noteref">830</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One word there was in all, and metre one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that all harmony appeared among them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Master,” I said, “are spirits those I hear?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he to me: “Thou apprehendest truly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they the knot of anger go unloosing.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And art discoursing of us even as though</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou didst by calends still divide the time?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-831" id="noteref-831" epub:type="noteref">831</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>After this manner by a voice was spoken;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereon my Master said: “Do thou reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ask if on this side the way go upward.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “O creature that dost cleanse thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To return beautiful to Him who made thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He answered; “and if smoke prevent our seeing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon began I: “With that swathing band</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which death unwindeth am I going upward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hither came I through the infernal anguish.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if God in his grace has me infolded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he wills that I behold his court</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By method wholly out of modern usage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But tell it me, and tell me if I go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-832" id="noteref-832" epub:type="noteref">832</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The world I knew, and loved that excellence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At which has each one now unbent his bow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For mounting upward, thou art going right.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus he made answer, and subjoined: “I pray thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To pray for me when thou shalt be above.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “My faith I pledge to thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First it was simple, and is now made double</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-833" id="noteref-833" epub:type="noteref">833</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The world forsooth is utterly deserted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By every virtue, as thou tellest me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with iniquity is big and covered;</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I may see it, and to others show it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-834" id="noteref-834" epub:type="noteref">834</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He first sent forth, and then began he: “Brother,</span>

					<span>Ye who are living every cause refer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-835" id="noteref-835" epub:type="noteref">835</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>If this were so, in you would be destroyed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-837" id="noteref-837" epub:type="noteref">837</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Free will, nor any justice would there be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In having joy for good, or grief for evil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heavens your movements do initiate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I say not all; but granting that I say it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Light has been given you for good and evil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And free volition; which, if some fatigue</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Afterwards conquers all, if well ’tis nurtured.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-838" id="noteref-838" epub:type="noteref">838</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To greater force and to a better nature,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-839" id="noteref-839" epub:type="noteref">839</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though free, ye subject are, and that creates</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence, if the present world doth go astray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In you the cause is, be it sought in you;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I therein will now be thy true spy.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-840" id="noteref-840" epub:type="noteref">840</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before it is, like to a little girl</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of trivial good at first it tastes the savor;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is cheated by it, and runs after it,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-841" id="noteref-841" epub:type="noteref">841</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If guide or rein turn not aside its love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behoved a king to have, who at the least</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the true city should discern the tower.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-842" id="noteref-842" epub:type="noteref">842</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No one; because the shepherd who precedes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-843" id="noteref-843" epub:type="noteref">843</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore the people that perceives its guide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strike only at the good for which it hankers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-844" id="noteref-844" epub:type="noteref">844</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cause is that has made the world depraved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not that nature is corrupt in you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rome, that reformed the world, accustomed was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two suns to have, which one road and the other,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-845" id="noteref-845" epub:type="noteref">845</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of God and of the world, made manifest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One has the other quenched, and to the crosier</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That by main force one with the other go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because, being joined, one feareth not the other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou believe not, think upon the grain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For by its seed each herb is recognized.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the land laved by Po and Adige,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-846" id="noteref-846" epub:type="noteref">846</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Valor and courtesy used to be found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before that Frederick had his controversy;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-847" id="noteref-847" epub:type="noteref">847</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now in security can pass that way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True, three old men are left, in whom upbraids</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ancient age the new, and late they deem it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That God restore them to the better life:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Currado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-848" id="noteref-848" epub:type="noteref">848</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Guido da Castel, who better named is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Confounding in itself two governments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Marco mine,” I said, “thou reasonest well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now discern I why the sons of Levi</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have been excluded from the heritage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-849" id="noteref-849" epub:type="noteref">849</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In reprobation of the barbarous age?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He answered me; “for speaking Tuscan to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By other surname do I know him not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-850" id="noteref-850" epub:type="noteref">850</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May God be with you, for I come no farther.</span>

					<span>Behold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already whitening; and I must depart⁠—</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A mist o’ertook thee, through which thou couldst see<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-852" id="noteref-852" epub:type="noteref">852</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How, when the vapors humid and condensed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the sun feebly enters in among them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thy imagination will be swift</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In coming to perceive how I re-saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sun at first, that was already setting.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rays already dead on the low shores.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By self, or by a will that downward guides it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of her impiety, who changed her form<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-853" id="noteref-853" epub:type="noteref">853</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the bird that most delights in singing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In my imagining appeared the trace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within itself, that from without there came</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nothing that then might be received by it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then rained within my lofty fantasy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-854" id="noteref-854" epub:type="noteref">854</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One crucified, disdainful and ferocious</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In countenance, and even thus was dying.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around him were the great Ahasuerus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who was in word and action so entire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as this image burst asunder</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which the water it was made of fails,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There rose up in my vision a young maiden<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-855" id="noteref-855" epub:type="noteref">855</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bitterly weeping, and she said: “O queen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou’st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mother, at thine ere at another’s ruin.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And broken quivers e’er it dieth wholly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So this imagining of mine fell down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As soon as the effulgence smote my face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Greater by far than what is in our wont.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I turned me round to see where I might be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When said a voice, “Here is the passage up”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which from all other purposes removed me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made my wish so full of eagerness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To look and see who was it that was speaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It never rests till meeting face to face;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as before the sun, which quells the sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in its own excess its figure veils,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-856" id="noteref-856" epub:type="noteref">856</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even so my power was insufficient here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“This is a spirit divine, who in the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of going up directs us without asking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who with his own light himself conceals.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He does with us as man doth with himself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Malignly leans already tow’rds denial.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Accord we now our feet to such inviting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For then we could not till the day return.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus my Conductor said; and I and he</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I, as soon as the first step I reached,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Near me perceived a motion as of wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fanning in the face, and saying, “<i xml:lang="la">Beati</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-857" id="noteref-857" epub:type="noteref">857</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1"><i xml:lang="la">Pacifici</i>, who are without ill anger.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already over us were so uplifted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That upon many sides the stars appeared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said within myself; for I perceived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The vigor of my legs was put in truce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We at the point were where no more ascends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The stairway upward, and were motionless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I gave heed a little, if I might hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aught whatsoever in the circle new;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to my Master turned me round and said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is purged here in the circle where we are?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span id="purgatorio-canto-17-line-85">And he to me: “The love of good, remiss<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-858" id="noteref-858" epub:type="noteref">858</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In what it should have done, is here restored;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here plied again the ill-belated oar;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But still more openly to understand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some profitable fruit from our delay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span id="purgatorio-canto-17-line-91">Neither Creator nor a creature ever,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Son,” he began, “was destitute of love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The natural was ever without error;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But err the other may by evil object,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or by too much, or by too little vigor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While in the first it well directed is,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-859" id="noteref-859" epub:type="noteref">859</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the second moderates itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when to ill it turns, and, with more care</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Gainst the Creator works his own creation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The seed within yourselves of every virtue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every act that merits punishment.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now inasmuch as never from the welfare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of its own subject can love turn its sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From their own hatred all things are secure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And since we cannot think of any being</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Standing alone, nor from the First divided,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of hating Him is all desire cut off.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The evil that one loves is of one’s neighbor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this is born in three modes in your clay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There are, who, by abasement of their neighbor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hope to excel, and therefore only long</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from his greatness he may be cast down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There are, who power, grace, honor, and renown</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fear they may lose because another rises,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it makes them greedy for revenge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And such must needs shape out another’s harm.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This threefold love is wept for down below;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-860" id="noteref-860" epub:type="noteref">860</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now of the other will I have thee hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That runneth after good with measure faulty.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each one confusedly a good conceives</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore to overtake it each one strives.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If languid love to look on this attract you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After just penitence, torments you for it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There’s other good that does not make man happy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis not felicity, ’tis not the good</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Essence, of every good the fruit and root.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The love that yields itself too much to this<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-861" id="noteref-861" epub:type="noteref">861</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above us is lamented in three circles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But how tripartite it may be described,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say not, that thou seek it for thyself.”</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Then even as the fire doth upward move</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By its own form, which to ascend is born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where longest in its matter it endures,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-865" id="noteref-865" epub:type="noteref">865</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So comes the captive soul into desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is a motion spiritual, and ne’er rests</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until she doth enjoy the thing beloved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now may apparent be to thee how hidden</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The truth is from those people, who aver</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All love is in itself a laudable thing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because its matter may perchance appear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aye to be good; but yet not each impression</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is good, albeit good may be the wax.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thy words, and my sequacious intellect,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I answered him, “have love revealed to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that has made me more impregned with doubt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if love from without be offered us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with another foot the soul go not,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-866" id="noteref-866" epub:type="noteref">866</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If right or wrong she go, ’tis not her merit.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “What reason seeth here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Myself can tell thee; beyond that await</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Beatrice, since ’tis a work of faith.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every substantial form, that segregate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-867" id="noteref-867" epub:type="noteref">867</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From matter is, and with it is united,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Specific power has in itself collected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which without act is not perceptible,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor shows itself except by its effect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As life does in a plant by the green leaves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But still, whence cometh the intelligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the first notions, man is ignorant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the affection for the first allurements,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which are in you as instinct in the bee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make its honey; and this first desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Merit of praise or blame containeth not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, that to this all others may be gathered,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-868" id="noteref-868" epub:type="noteref">868</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Innate within you is the power that counsels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And it should keep the threshold of assent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is the principle, from which is taken</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Occasion of desert in you, according</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As good and guilty loves it takes and winnows.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-869" id="noteref-869" epub:type="noteref">869</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those who, in reasoning, to the bottom went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were of this innate liberty aware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore bequeathed they Ethics to the world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Supposing, then, that from necessity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Springs every love that is within you kindled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within yourselves the power is to restrain it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The noble virtue Beatrice understands<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-870" id="noteref-870" epub:type="noteref">870</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the free will; and therefore see that thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bear it in mind, if she should speak of it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The moon, belated almost unto midnight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-871" id="noteref-871" epub:type="noteref">871</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now made the stars appear to us more rare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Formed like a bucket, that is all ablaze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And counter to the heavens ran through those paths</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the sun sets aflame, when he of Rome<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-872" id="noteref-872" epub:type="noteref">872</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sees it ’twixt Sardes and Corsicans go down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that patrician shade, for whom is named</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pietola more than any Mantuan town,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-873" id="noteref-873" epub:type="noteref">873</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had laid aside the burden of my lading;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-874" id="noteref-874" epub:type="noteref">874</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I, who reason manifest and plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In answer to my questions had received,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stood like a man in drowsy reverie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But taken from me was this drowsiness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suddenly by a people, that behind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our backs already had come round to us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-875" id="noteref-875" epub:type="noteref">875</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beside them saw at night the rush and throng,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So they along that circle curve their step,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-876" id="noteref-876" epub:type="noteref">876</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From what I saw of those approaching us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full soon they were upon us, because running</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moved onward all that mighty multitude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And two in the advance cried out, lamenting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Mary in haste unto the mountain ran,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-877" id="noteref-877" epub:type="noteref">877</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-878" id="noteref-878" epub:type="noteref">878</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By little love!” forthwith the others cried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“For ardor in well-doing freshens grace!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O folk, in whom an eager fervor now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Supplies perhaps delay and negligence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Put by you in well-doing, through lukewarmness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one who lives, and truly I lie not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would fain go up, if but the sun relight us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So tell us where the passage nearest is.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These were the words of him who was my Guide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And someone of those spirits said: “Come on</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So full of longing are we to move onward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou for churlishness our justice take.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was San Zeno’s Abbot at Verona,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-879" id="noteref-879" epub:type="noteref">879</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under the empire of good Barbarossa,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-880" id="noteref-880" epub:type="noteref">880</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he has one foot in the grave already,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-881" id="noteref-881" epub:type="noteref">881</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who shall erelong lament that monastery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sorry be of having there had power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because his son, in his whole body sick,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And worse in mind, and who was evil-born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He put into the place of its true pastor.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If more he said, or silent was, I know not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had already passed so far beyond us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he who was in every need my succor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Turn thee hitherward; see two of them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-882" id="noteref-882" epub:type="noteref">882</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In rear of all they shouted: “Sooner were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The people dead to whom the sea was opened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than their inheritors the Jordan saw;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-883" id="noteref-883" epub:type="noteref">883</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And those who the fatigue did not endure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the issue, with Anchises’ son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-884" id="noteref-884" epub:type="noteref">884</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Themselves to life withouten glory offered.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then when from us so separated were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those shades, that they no longer could be seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within me a new thought did entrance find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence others many and diverse were born;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so I lapsed from one into another,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in a reverie mine eyes I closed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And meditation into dream transmuted.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-885" id="noteref-885" epub:type="noteref">885</a></span>

					<span>It was the hour when the diurnal heat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-886" id="noteref-886" epub:type="noteref">886</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more can warm the coldness of the moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vanquished by earth, or peradventure Saturn,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-887" id="noteref-887" epub:type="noteref">887</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When geomancers their Fortuna Major<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-888" id="noteref-888" epub:type="noteref">888</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">See in the orient before the dawn</span>

					<br/>
					<span>There came to me in dreams a stammering woman,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-890" id="noteref-890" epub:type="noteref">890</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With hands dissevered and of sallow hue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I looked at her; and as the sun restores</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The frigid members which the night benumbs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even thus my gaze did render voluble</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her tongue, and made her all erect thereafter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In little while, and the lost countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As love desires it so in her did color.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When in this wise she had her speech unloosed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She ’gan to sing so, that with difficulty</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could I have turned my thoughts away from her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I am,” she sang, “I am the Siren sweet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who mariners amid the main unman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So full am I of pleasantness to hear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I drew Ulysses from his wandering way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my song, and he who dwells with me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seldom departs so wholly I content him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her mouth was not yet closed again, before</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appeared a Lady saintly and alert</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Close at my side to put her to confusion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Virgilius, O Virgilius! who is this?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sternly she said; and he was drawing near</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With eyes still fixed upon that modest one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She seized the other and in front laid open,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rending her garments, and her belly showed me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This waked me with the stench that issued from it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I turned mine eyes, and good Virgilius said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“At least thrice have I called thee; rise and come;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I rose; and full already of high day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were all the circles of the Sacred Mountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the new sun at our back we went.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Following behind him, I my forehead bore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like unto one who has it laden with thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who makes himself the half arch of a bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I heard say, “Come, here the passage is,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spoken in a manner gentle and benign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as we hear not in this mortal region.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With open wings, which of a swan appeared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upward he turned us who thus spake to us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between the two walls of the solid granite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Affirming those <i xml:lang="la">qui lugent</i> to be blessed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For they shall have their souls with comfort filled.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-891" id="noteref-891" epub:type="noteref">891</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What aileth thee, that aye to earth thou gazest?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me my Guide began to say, we both</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat beyond the Angel having mounted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “With such misgiving makes me go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A vision new, which bends me to itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Didst thou behold,” he said, “that old enchantress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who sole above us henceforth is lamented?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-892" id="noteref-892" epub:type="noteref">892</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Didst thou behold how man is freed from her?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suffice it thee, and smite earth with thy heels,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-893" id="noteref-893" epub:type="noteref">893</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine eyes lift upward to the lure, that whirls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Eternal King with revolutions vast.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the hawk, that first his feet surveys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then turns him to the call and stretches forward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the desire of food that draws him thither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such I became, and such, as far as cleaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rock to give a way to him who mounts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Went on to where the circling doth begin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the fifth circle when I had come forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">People I saw upon it who were weeping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stretched prone upon the ground, all downward turned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">Adhæsit pavimento anima mea</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-894" id="noteref-894" epub:type="noteref">894</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I heard them say with sighings so profound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hardly could the words be understood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O ye elect of God, whose sufferings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Justice and Hope both render less severe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Direct ye us towards the high ascents.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If ye are come secure from this prostration,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wish to find the way most speedily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let your right hands be evermore outside.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did the Poet ask, and thus was answered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By them somewhat in front of us; whence I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In what was spoken divined the rest concealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto my Lord’s eyes mine eyes I turned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence he assented with a cheerful sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To what the sight of my desire implored.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When of myself I could dispose at will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above that creature did I draw myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose words before had caused me to take note,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saying: “O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That without which to God we cannot turn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suspend awhile for me thy greater care.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who wast thou, and why are your backs turned upwards,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell me, and if thou wouldst that I procure thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Anything there whence living I departed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Wherefore our backs the heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turns to itself, know shalt thou; but beforehand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">

					<span>Between Siestri and Chiaveri descends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A river beautiful, and of its name</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The title of my blood its summit makes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A month and little more essayed I how</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weighs the great cloak on him from mire who keeps it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all the other burdens seem a feather.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tardy, ah woe is me! was my conversion;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when the Roman Shepherd I was made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then I discovered life to be a lie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw that there the heart was not at rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor farther in that life could one ascend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby the love of this was kindled in me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until that time a wretched soul and parted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From God was I, and wholly avaricious;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now, as thou seest, I here am punished for it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What avarice does is here made manifest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the purgation of these souls converted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And no more bitter pain the Mountain has.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as our eye did not uplift itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aloft, being fastened upon earthly things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So justice here has merged it in the earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As avarice had extinguished our affection</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For every good, whereby was action lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So justice here doth hold us in restraint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bound and imprisoned by the feet and hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so long as it pleases the just Lord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall we remain immovable and prostrate.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I on my knees had fallen, and wished to speak;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But even as I began, and he was ’ware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only by listening, of my reverence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What cause,” he said, “has downward bent thee thus?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I to him: “For your own dignity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Standing, my conscience stung me with remorse.”</span>

					<span class="i1">Therefore, to pleasure him, against my pleasure<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-901" id="noteref-901" epub:type="noteref">901</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I drew the sponge not saturate from the water.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Onward I moved, and onward moved my Leader,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through vacant places, skirting still the rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As on a wall close to the battlements;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For they that through their eyes pour drop by drop</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The malady which all the world pervades,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On the other side too near the verge approach.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Accursed mayst thou be, thou old she-wolf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That more than all the other beasts hast prey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because of hunger infinitely hollow!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O heaven, in whose gyrations some appear<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-902" id="noteref-902" epub:type="noteref">902</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To think conditions here below are changed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When will he come through whom she shall depart?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-903" id="noteref-903" epub:type="noteref">903</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Onward we went with footsteps slow and scarce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I attentive to the shades I heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Piteously weeping and bemoaning them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I by peradventure heard “Sweet Mary!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uttered in front of us amid the weeping</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a woman does who is in child-birth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in continuance: “How poor thou wast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is manifested by that hostelry<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-904" id="noteref-904" epub:type="noteref">904</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafterward I heard: “O good Fabricius,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-905" id="noteref-905" epub:type="noteref">905</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virtue with poverty didst thou prefer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the possession of great wealth with vice.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So pleasurable were these words to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I drew farther onward to have knowledge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Touching that spirit whence they seemed to come.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He furthermore was speaking of the largess<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-906" id="noteref-906" epub:type="noteref">906</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Nicholas unto the maidens gave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-907" id="noteref-907" epub:type="noteref">907</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In order to conduct their youth to honor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O soul that dost so excellently speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell me who wast thou,” said I, “and why only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou dost renew these praises well deserved?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not without recompense shall be thy word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I return to finish the short journey</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that life which is flying to its end.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “I’ll tell thee, not for any comfort</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I may expect from earth, but that so much</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grace shines in thee or ever thou art dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was the root of that malignant plant<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-908" id="noteref-908" epub:type="noteref">908</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which overshadows all the Christian world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that good fruit is seldom gathered from it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if Douay and Ghent, and Lille and Bruges</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had power, soon vengeance would be taken on it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this I pray of Him who judges all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hugh Capet was I called upon the earth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From me were born the Louises and Philips,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-909" id="noteref-909" epub:type="noteref">909</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By whom in later days has France been governed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was the son of a Parisian butcher,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-910" id="noteref-910" epub:type="noteref">910</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time the ancient kings had perished all,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-911" id="noteref-911" epub:type="noteref">911</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Excepting one, contrite in cloth of gray.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I found me grasping in my hands the rein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the realm’s government, and so great power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of new acquest, and so with friends abounding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to the widowed diadem promoted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The head of mine own offspring was, from whom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-912" id="noteref-912" epub:type="noteref">912</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The consecrated bones of these began.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long as the great dowry of Provence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-913" id="noteref-913" epub:type="noteref">913</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of my blood took not the sense of shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twas little worth, but still it did no harm.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then it began with falsehood and with force</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its rapine; and thereafter, for amends,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-914" id="noteref-914" epub:type="noteref">914</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Took Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Charles came to Italy, and for amends<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-915" id="noteref-915" epub:type="noteref">915</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A victim made of Conradin, and then<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-916" id="noteref-916" epub:type="noteref">916</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrust Thomas back to heaven, for amends.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-917" id="noteref-917" epub:type="noteref">917</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A time I see, not very distant now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which draweth forth another Charles from France,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-918" id="noteref-918" epub:type="noteref">918</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The better to make known both him and his.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unarmed he goes, and only with the lance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Judas jousted with; and that he thrusts<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-919" id="noteref-919" epub:type="noteref">919</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-920" id="noteref-920" epub:type="noteref">920</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thence not land, but sin and infamy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-921" id="noteref-921" epub:type="noteref">921</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall gain, so much more grievous to himself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As the more light such damage he accounts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other, now gone forth, ta’en in his ship,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-922" id="noteref-922" epub:type="noteref">922</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">See I his daughter sell, and chaffer for her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As corsairs do with other female slaves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What more, O Avarice, canst thou do to us,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-923" id="noteref-923" epub:type="noteref">923</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since thou my blood so to thyself hast drawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It careth not for its own proper flesh?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That less may seem the future ill and past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I see the flower-de-luce Alagna enter,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-924" id="noteref-924" epub:type="noteref">924</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Christ in his own Vicar captive made.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-925" id="noteref-925" epub:type="noteref">925</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see him yet another time derided;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I see renewed the vinegar and gall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And between living thieves I see him slain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the modern Pilate so relentless,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-926" id="noteref-926" epub:type="noteref">926</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This does not sate him, but without decretal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He to the temple bears his sordid sails!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, O my Lord! shall I be joyful made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By looking on the vengeance which, concealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Makes sweet thine anger in thy secrecy?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What I was saying of that only bride<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-927" id="noteref-927" epub:type="noteref">927</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the Holy Ghost, and which occasioned thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To turn towards me for some commentary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long has been ordained to all our prayers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As the day lasts; but when the night comes on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Contrary sound we take instead thereof.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At that time we repeat Pygmalion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-928" id="noteref-928" epub:type="noteref">928</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom a traitor, thief, and parricide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made his insatiable desire of gold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the misery of avaricious Midas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-929" id="noteref-929" epub:type="noteref">929</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That followed his inordinate demand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At which forevermore one needs but laugh.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The foolish Achan each one then records,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-930" id="noteref-930" epub:type="noteref">930</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how he stole the spoils; so that the wrath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Joshua still appears to sting him here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then we accuse Sapphira with her husband,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-931" id="noteref-931" epub:type="noteref">931</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We laud the hoof-beats Heliodorus had,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-932" id="noteref-932" epub:type="noteref">932</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the whole mount in infamy encircles</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Polymnestor who murdered Polydorus.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-933" id="noteref-933" epub:type="noteref">933</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here finally is cried: ‘O Crassus, tell us,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-934" id="noteref-934" epub:type="noteref">934</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thou dost know, what is the taste of gold?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes we speak, one loud, another low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According to desire of speech, that spurs us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To greater now and now to lesser pace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in the good that here by day is talked of,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Erewhile alone I was not; yet near by<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-935" id="noteref-935" epub:type="noteref">935</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No other person lifted up his voice.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From him already we departed were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made endeavor to o’ercome the road</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much as was permitted to our power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I perceived, like something that is falling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mountain tremble, whence a chill seized on me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-936" id="noteref-936" epub:type="noteref">936</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As seizes him who to his death is going.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certes so violently shook not Delos,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-937" id="noteref-937" epub:type="noteref">937</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before Latona made her nest therein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To give birth to the two eyes of the heaven.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then upon all sides there began a cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such that the Master drew himself towards me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying, “Fear not, while I am guiding thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">Gloria in excelsis Deo</i>,” all<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-938" id="noteref-938" epub:type="noteref">938</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were saying, from what near I comprehended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where it was possible to hear the cry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We paused immovable and in suspense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as the shepherds who first heard that song,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-939" id="noteref-939" epub:type="noteref">939</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the trembling ceased, and it was finished.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then we resumed again our holy path,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watching the shades that lay upon the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already turned to their accustomed plaint.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No ignorance ever with so great a strife</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had rendered me importunate to know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If erreth not in this my memory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As meditating then I seemed to have;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor out of haste to question did I dare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor of myself I there could aught perceive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I went onward timorous and thoughtful.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Put me in travail, and haste goaded me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the encumbered path behind my Leader,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I was pitying that righteous vengeance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-942" id="noteref-942" epub:type="noteref">942</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Christ appeared to two upon the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the sepulchral cave already risen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A shade appeared to us, and came behind us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down gazing on the prostrate multitude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor were we ware of it, until it spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saying, “My brothers, may God give you peace!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To him the countersign thereto conforming.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-943" id="noteref-943" epub:type="noteref">943</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon began he: “In the blessed council,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thee may the court veracious place in peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That me doth banish in eternal exile!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“How,” said he, and the while we went with speed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who up his stairs so far has guided you?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said my Teacher: “If thou note the marks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-944" id="noteref-944" epub:type="noteref">944</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But because she who spinneth day and night<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-945" id="noteref-945" epub:type="noteref">945</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His soul, which is thy sister and my own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In coming upwards could not come alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason that it sees not in our fashion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far on as my school has power to lead.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-946" id="noteref-946" epub:type="noteref">946</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In asking he so hit the very eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of my desire, that merely with the hope</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My thirst became the less unsatisfied.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Naught is there,” he began, “that without order<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-947" id="noteref-947" epub:type="noteref">947</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can be of this the cause, and naught beside;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-950" id="noteref-950" epub:type="noteref">950</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That often upon earth her region shifts;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No arid vapor any farther rises</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,</span>

					<span class="i1">I know not how, up here it never trembled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It trembles here, whenever any soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of purity the will alone gives proof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, being wholly free to change its convent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First it wills well; but the desire permits not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which divine justice with the self-same will<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-951" id="noteref-951" epub:type="noteref">951</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There was to sin, upon the torment sets.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who have been lying in this pain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Five hundred years and more, but just now felt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A free volition for a better seat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spirits along the mountain rendering praise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So said he to him; and since we enjoy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much in drinking as the thirst is great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I could not say how much it did me good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the wise Leader: “Now I see the net</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That snares you here, and how ye are set free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why the earth quakes, and wherefore ye rejoice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And why so many centuries thou hast here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Been lying, let me gather from thy words.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In days when the good Titus, with the aid<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-952" id="noteref-952" epub:type="noteref">952</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the supremest King, avenged the wounds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence issued forth the blood by Judas sold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the name that most endures and honors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was I on earth,” that spirit made reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Greatly renowned, but not with faith as yet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My vocal spirit was so sweet, that Rome</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me, a Thoulousian, drew unto herself,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-953" id="noteref-953" epub:type="noteref">953</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where I deserved to deck my brows with myrtle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Statius the people name me still on earth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I sang of Thebes, and then of great Achilles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But on the way fell with my second burden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The seeds unto my ardor were the sparks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that celestial flame which heated me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby more than a thousand have been fired;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the Aeneid speak I, which to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A mother was, and was my nurse in song;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without this weighed I not a drachma’s weight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to have lived upon the earth what time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virgilius lived, I would accept one sun<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-954" id="noteref-954" epub:type="noteref">954</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than I must ere issuing from my ban.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These words towards me made Virgilius turn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With looks that in their silence said, “Be silent!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But yet the power that wills cannot do all things;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For tears and laughter are such pursuivants</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the passion from which each springs forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the most truthful least the will they follow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into mine eyes, where most expression dwells;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, “As thou well mayst consummate a labor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So great,” it said, “why did thy face just now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Display to me the lightning of a smile?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-955" id="noteref-955" epub:type="noteref">955</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now am I caught on this side and on that;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Speak,” said my Master, “and be not afraid</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of speaking, but speak out, and say to him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What he demands with such solicitude.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I: “Thou peradventure marvellest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O antique spirit, at the smile I gave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I will have more wonder seize upon thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one, who guides on high these eyes of mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is that Virgilius, from whom thou didst learn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To sing aloud of men and of the Gods.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If other cause thou to my smile imputedst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Abandon it as false, and trust it was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already he was stooping to embrace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Teacher’s feet; but he said to him: “Brother,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-956" id="noteref-956" epub:type="noteref">956</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he uprising: “Now canst thou the sum</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of love which warms me to thee comprehend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When this our vanity I disremember,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Treating a shadow as substantial thing.”</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Angel who to the sixth round had turned us,</span>

					<span class="i1">Having erased one mark from off my face;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And those who have in justice their desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had said to us, “<i xml:lang="la">Beati</i>,” in their voices,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-958" id="noteref-958" epub:type="noteref">958</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With “<i xml:lang="la">sitio</i>,” and without more ended it.</span>

					<span>And I, more light than through the other passes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Went onward so, that without any labor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I followed upward the swift-footed spirits;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When thus Virgilius began: “The love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kindled by virtue aye another kindles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Provided outwardly its flame appear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence from the hour that Juvenal descended<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-959" id="noteref-959" epub:type="noteref">959</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among us into the infernal Limbo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who made apparent to me thy affection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My kindliness towards thee was as great</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As ever bound one to an unseen person,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that these stairs will now seem short to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me, and forgive me as a friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If too great confidence let loose the rein,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as a friend now hold discourse with me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How was it possible within thy breast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For avarice to find place, ’mid so much wisdom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou wast filled with by thy diligence?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These words excited Statius at first</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat to laughter; afterward he answered:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Each word of thine is love’s dear sign to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Verily oftentimes do things appear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which give fallacious matter to our doubts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Instead of the true causes which are hidden!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy question shows me thy belief to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I was niggard in the other life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It may be from the circle where I was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore know thou, that avarice was removed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Too far from me; and this extravagance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thousands of lunar periods have punished.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And were it not that I my thoughts uplifted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I the passage heard where thou exclaimest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if indignant, unto human nature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘To what impellest thou not, O cursed hunger<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-960" id="noteref-960" epub:type="noteref">960</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Revolving I should feel the dismal joustings.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-961" id="noteref-961" epub:type="noteref">961</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their wings in spending, and repented me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As well of that as of my other sins;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How many with shorn hair shall rise again<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-962" id="noteref-962" epub:type="noteref">962</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because of ignorance, which from this sin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cuts off repentance living and in death!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And know that the transgression which rebuts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By direct opposition any sin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Together with it here its verdure dries.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore if I have been among that folk</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which mourns its avarice, to purify me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For its opposite has this befallen me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now when thou sangest the relentless weapons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the twofold affliction of Jocasta,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-963" id="noteref-963" epub:type="noteref">963</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The singer of the Songs Bucolic said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“From that which Clio there with thee preludes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-964" id="noteref-964" epub:type="noteref">964</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It does not seem that yet had made thee faithful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That faith without which no good works suffice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If this be so, what candles or what sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy sails behind the Fisherman thereafter?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-965" id="noteref-965" epub:type="noteref">965</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to him: “Thou first directedst me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards Parnassus, in its grots to drink,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And first concerning God didst me enlighten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou didst as he who walketh in the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who bears his light behind, which helps him not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But maketh wise the persons after him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When thou didst say: ‘The age renews itself,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-966" id="noteref-966" epub:type="noteref">966</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Justice returns, and man’s primeval time,</span>

					<span class="i1">To color it will I extend my hand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already was the world in every part</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By messengers of the eternal kingdom;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thy assertion, spoken of above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the new preachers was in unison;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I to visit them the custom took.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then they became so holy in my sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, when Domitian persecuted them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not without tears of mine were their laments;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the while that I on earth remained,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them I befriended, and their upright customs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made me disparage all the other sects.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Thebes, in poetry, I was baptized,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But out of fear was covertly a Christian,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For a long time professing paganism;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-967" id="noteref-967" epub:type="noteref">967</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To circuit round more than four centuries.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou, therefore, who hast raised the covering</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hid from me whatever good I speak of,</span>

					<span class="i1">While in ascending we have time to spare,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied my Leader, “with that Grecian are<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-971" id="noteref-971" epub:type="noteref">971</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There some of thine own people may be seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Antigone, Deiphile and Argìa,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-974" id="noteref-974" epub:type="noteref">974</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there Ismene mournful as of old.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There she is seen who pointed out Langìa;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-975" id="noteref-975" epub:type="noteref">975</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There is Tiresias’ daughter, and there Thetis,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-976" id="noteref-976" epub:type="noteref">976</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there Deidamia with her sisters.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-977" id="noteref-977" epub:type="noteref">977</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silent already were the poets both,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Attent once more in looking round about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the ascent and from the walls released;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And four handmaidens of the day already<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-978" id="noteref-978" epub:type="noteref">978</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were left behind, and at the pole the fifth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was pointing upward still its burning horn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What time my Guide: “I think that tow’rds the edge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Circling the mount as we are wont to do.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus in that region custom was our ensign;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And we resumed our way with less suspicion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the assenting of that worthy soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They in advance went on, and I alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind them, and I listened to their speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which gave me lessons in the art of song.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But soon their sweet discourses interrupted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A tree which midway in the road we found,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-979" id="noteref-979" epub:type="noteref">979</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With apples sweet and grateful to the smell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as a fir-tree tapers upward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From bough to bough, so downwardly did that;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I think in order that no one might climb it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On that side where our pathway was enclosed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spread itself abroad upon the leaves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Poets twain unto the tree drew near,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from among the foliage a voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried: “Of this food ye shall have scarcity.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said: “More thoughtful Mary was of making<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-980" id="noteref-980" epub:type="noteref">980</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The marriage feast complete and honorable,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disparaged food, and understanding won.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The primal age was beautiful as gold;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-982" id="noteref-982" epub:type="noteref">982</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Acorns it made with hunger savorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And nectar every rivulet with thirst.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Honey and locusts were the aliments</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That fed the Baptist in the wilderness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence he is glorious, and so magnified</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began I; and he answered: “Shades that go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, unknown people on the road o’ertaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turn themselves round to them, and do not stop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus, behind us with a swifter motion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Coming and passing onward, gazed upon us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A crowd of spirits silent and devout.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pallid in face, and so emaciate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from the bones the skin did shape itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think that so to merest rind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could Erisichthon have been withered up<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-986" id="noteref-986" epub:type="noteref">986</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By famine, when most fear he had of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thinking within myself I said: “Behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This is the folk who lost Jerusalem,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Mary made a prey of her own son.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-987" id="noteref-987" epub:type="noteref">987</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their sockets were like rings without the gems;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-988" id="noteref-988" epub:type="noteref">988</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoever in the face of men reads <em>omo</em><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-989" id="noteref-989" epub:type="noteref">989</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might well in these have recognized the <em>m</em>.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who would believe the odor of an apple,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Begetting longing, could consume them so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that of water, without knowing how?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I still was wondering what so famished them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the occasion not yet manifest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of their emaciation and sad squalor;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! from out the hollow of his head</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then cried aloud: “What grace to me is this?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never should I have known him by his look;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in his voice was evident to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which his aspect had suppressed within it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This spark within me wholly re-enkindled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My recognition of his altered face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I recalled the features of Forese.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-990" id="noteref-990" epub:type="noteref">990</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Entreated he, “which doth my skin discolor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor at default of flesh that I may have;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me truth of thee, and who are those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not delay in speaking unto me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That face of thine, which dead I once bewept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I answered him, “beholding it so changed!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me, for God’s sake, what thus denudes you?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make me not speak while I am marvelling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ill speaks he who’s full of other longings.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “From the eternal council</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Falls power into the water and the tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind us left, whereby I grow so thin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All of this people who lamenting sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For following beyond measure appetite</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hunger and thirst are here re-sanctified.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Desire to eat and drink enkindles in us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The scent that issues from the apple-tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from the spray that sprinkles o’er the verdure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not a single time alone, this ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Encircling, is renewed our pain⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I say our pain, and ought to say our solace⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the same wish doth lead us to the tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which led the Christ rejoicing to say <i xml:lang="grc-Latn">Eli</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-991" id="noteref-991" epub:type="noteref">991</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “Forese, from that day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When for a better life thou changedst worlds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up to this time five years have not rolled round.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If sooner were the power exhausted in thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of sinning more, than thee the hour surprised</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How hast thou come up hitherward already?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I thought to find thee down there underneath,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-993" id="noteref-993" epub:type="noteref">993</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where time for time doth restitution make.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Thus speedily has led me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Nella with her overflowing tears;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-994" id="noteref-994" epub:type="noteref">994</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>She with her prayers devout and with her sighs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has drawn me from the coast where one awaits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from the other circles set me free.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So much more dear and pleasing is to God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My little widow, whom so much I loved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in good works she is the more alone;</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By far more modest in its women is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than the Barbagia I have left her in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O brother sweet, what wilt thou have me say?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A future time is in my sight already,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which this hour will not be very old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When from the pulpit shall be interdicted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the unblushing womankind of Florence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To go about displaying breast and paps.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-996" id="noteref-996" epub:type="noteref">996</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>What savages were e’er, what Saracens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who stood in need, to make them covered go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of spiritual or other discipline?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if the shameless women were assured</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of what swift Heaven prepares for them, already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wide open would they have their mouths to howl;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if my foresight here deceive me not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O brother, now no longer hide thee from me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">See that not only I, but all these people</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are gazing there, where thou dost veil the sun.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I to him: “If thou bring back to mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What thou with me hast been and I with thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The present memory will be grievous still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of that life he turned me back who goes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In front of me, two days agone when round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sister of him yonder showed herself,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the sun I pointed. “Through the deep</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Night of the truly dead has this one led me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With this true flesh, that follows after him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence his encouragements have led me up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ascending and still circling round the mount</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That you doth straighten, whom the world made crooked.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He says that he will bear me company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till I shall be where Beatrice will be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There it behoves me to remain without him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is Virgilius, who thus says to me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him I pointed at; “the other is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That shade for whom just now shook every slope<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-997" id="noteref-997" epub:type="noteref">997</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Even as a vessel urged by a good wind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shadows, that appeared things doubly dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wonder at me, aware that I was living.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Peradventure he goes up more slowly</span>

					<br/>
					<span>So said he first, and then: “ ’Tis not forbidden</span>

					<span>He named me many others one by one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all contented seemed at being named,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that for this I saw not one dark look.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw for hunger bite the empty air<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1004" id="noteref-1004" epub:type="noteref">1004</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Who with his crook had pastured many people.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1006" id="noteref-1006" epub:type="noteref">1006</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he was one who ne’er felt satisfied.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as he does who scans, and then doth prize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One more than others, did I him of Lucca,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1007" id="noteref-1007" epub:type="noteref">1007</a></span>

					<span class="i1">From that place heard I, where he felt the wound<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1008" id="noteref-1008" epub:type="noteref">1008</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of justice, that doth macerate them so.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O soul,” I said, “that seemest so desirous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with thy speech appease thyself and me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,”</span>

					<span class="i1">My city, howsoever men may blame it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">True things hereafter will declare it to thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But say if him I here behold, who forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1009" id="noteref-1009" epub:type="noteref">1009</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1"><em>Ladies, that have intelligence of love?</em>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1010" id="noteref-1010" epub:type="noteref">1010</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “One am I, who, whenever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he within me dictates, singing go.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O brother, now I see,” he said, “the knot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1011" id="noteref-1011" epub:type="noteref">1011</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do perceive full clearly how your pens</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Go closely following after him who dictates,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he who sets himself to go beyond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No difference sees from one style to another”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as if satisfied, he held his peace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the birds, that winter tow’rds the Nile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such wise all the people who were there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both by their leanness and their wishes light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a man, who weary is with trotting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lets his companions onward go, and walks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until he vents the panting of his chest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did Forese let the holy flock</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“When will it be that I again shall see thee?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“How long,” I answered, “I may live, I know not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet my return will not so speedy be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I shall sooner in desire arrive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because the place where I was set to live</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From day to day of good is more depleted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And unto dismal ruin seems ordained.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now go,” he said, “for him most guilty of it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1012" id="noteref-1012" epub:type="noteref">1012</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At a beast’s tail behold I dragged along</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards the valley where is no repentance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faster at every step the beast is going,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Increasing evermore until it smites him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And leaves the body vilely mutilated.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not long those wheels shall turn,” and he uplifted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His eyes to heaven, “ere shall be clear to thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which my speech no farther can declare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now stay behind; because the time so precious</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By coming onward thus abreast with thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A cavalier from out a troop that ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And seeks the honor of the first encounter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he with greater strides departed from us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on the road remained I with those two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who were such mighty marshals of the world.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1013" id="noteref-1013" epub:type="noteref">1013</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when before us he had gone so far</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As was my understanding to his words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appeared to me with laden and living boughs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another apple-tree, and not far distant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From having but just then turned thitherward.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1014" id="noteref-1014" epub:type="noteref">1014</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>People I saw beneath it lift their hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cry I know not what towards the leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like little children eager and deluded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, to make very keen their appetite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then they departed as if undeceived;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now we came unto the mighty tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Pass farther onward without drawing near;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1015" id="noteref-1015" epub:type="noteref">1015</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And out of that one has this tree been raised.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus said I know not who among the branches;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Went crowding forward on the side that rises.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Be mindful,” said he, “of the accursed ones<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1016" id="noteref-1016" epub:type="noteref">1016</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Combated Theseus with their double breasts;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence Gideon would not have them for companions<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1017" id="noteref-1017" epub:type="noteref">1017</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he tow’rds Midian the hills descended.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Followed forsooth by miserable gains;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then set at large upon the lonely road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A thousand steps and more we onward went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In contemplation, each without a word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As terrified and timid beasts are wont.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I raised my head to see who this might be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And never in a furnace was there seen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Metals or glass so lucent and so red</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As one I saw who said: “If it may please you<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1018" id="noteref-1018" epub:type="noteref">1018</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This way goes he who goeth after peace.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His aspect had bereft me of my sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as, the harbinger of early dawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My front, and felt the moving of the plumes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That breathed around an odor of ambrosia;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heard it said: “Blessed are they whom grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much illumines, that the love of taste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Excites not in their breasts too great desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hungering at all times so far as is just.”</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because the sun had his meridian circle</span>

					<span class="i1">To Taurus left, and night to Scorpio;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1020" id="noteref-1020" epub:type="noteref">1020</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore as doth a man who tarries not,</span>

					<span class="i1">But goes his way, whate’er to him appear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If of necessity the sting transfix him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this wise did we enter through the gap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Taking the stairway, one before the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which by its narrowness divides the climbers.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as the little stork that lifts its wing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a desire to fly, and does not venture</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To leave the nest, and lets it downward droop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even such was I, with the desire of asking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kindled and quenched, unto the motion coming</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He makes who doth address himself to speak.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1021" id="noteref-1021" epub:type="noteref">1021</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not for our pace, though rapid it might be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My father sweet forbore, but said: “Let fly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With confidence I opened then my mouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I began: “How can one meagre grow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the need of nutriment applies not?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1022" id="noteref-1022" epub:type="noteref">1022</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was wasted by the wasting of a brand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This would not,” said he, “be to thee so sour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trembles within a mirror your own image;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which seems hard would mellow seem to thee.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lo Statius here; and him I call and pray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He now will be the healer of thy wounds.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Responded Statius, “where thou present art,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he began: “Son, if these words of mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They’ll be thy light unto the How thou sayest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The perfect blood, which never is drunk up<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1023" id="noteref-1023" epub:type="noteref">1023</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the thirsty veins, and which remaineth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like food that from the table thou removest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Takes in the heart for all the human members</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virtue informative, as being that</span>

					<br/>
					<span>There one together with the other mingles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One to be passive meant, the other active</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason of the perfect place it springs from;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1024" id="noteref-1024" epub:type="noteref">1024</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And being conjoined, begins to operate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Coagulating first, then vivifying</span>

					<span class="i1">What for its matter it had made consistent.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As of a plant, (in so far different,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This on the way is, that arrived already,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then works so much, that now it moves and feels<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1026" id="noteref-1026" epub:type="noteref">1026</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a sea-fungus, and then undertakes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To organize the powers whose seed it is.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, Son, dilates and now distends itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The virtue from the generator’s heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where nature is intent on all the members.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But how from animal it man becomes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou dost not see as yet; this is a point</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which made a wiser man than thou once err</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So far, that in his doctrine separate</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he no organ saw by this assumed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Open thy breast unto the truth that’s coming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And know that, just as soon as in the foetus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The articulation of the brain is perfect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The primal Motor turns to it well pleased<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1028" id="noteref-1028" epub:type="noteref">1028</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At so great art of nature, and inspires</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A spirit new with virtue all replete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which what it finds there active doth attract</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into its substance, and becomes one soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which lives, and feels, and on itself revolves.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1029" id="noteref-1029" epub:type="noteref">1029</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that thou less may wonder at my word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold the sun’s heat, which becometh wine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Joined to the juice that from the vine distils.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whenever Lachesis has no more thread,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1030" id="noteref-1030" epub:type="noteref">1030</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It separates from the flesh, and virtually</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bears with itself the human and divine;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1031" id="noteref-1031" epub:type="noteref">1031</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other faculties are voiceless all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The memory, the intelligence, and the will</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In action far more vigorous than before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without a pause it falleth of itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In marvellous way on one shore or the other;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1032" id="noteref-1032" epub:type="noteref">1032</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There of its roads it first is cognizant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as the place there circumscribeth it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The virtue informative rays round about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As, and as much as, in the living members.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as the air, when full of rain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By alien rays that are therein reflected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With divers colors shows itself adorned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So there the neighboring air doth shape itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into that form which doth impress upon it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virtually the soul that has stood still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then in manner of the little flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which followeth the fire where’er it shifts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After the spirit followeth its new form.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It is called shade; and thence it organizes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereafter every sense, even to the sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence is it that we speak, and thence we laugh;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1033" id="noteref-1033" epub:type="noteref">1033</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>According as impress us our desires</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And other affections, so the shade is shaped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this is cause of what thou wonderest at.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now unto the last of all the circles</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had we arrived, and to the right hand turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And were attentive to another care.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There the embankment shoots forth flames of fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That drives them back, and from itself sequesters.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence we must needs go on the open side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one by one; and I did fear the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On this side, and on that the falling down.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Leader said: “Along this place one ought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing that one so easily might err.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">Summæ Deus clementiæ</i>,” in the bosom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1034" id="noteref-1034" epub:type="noteref">1034</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the great burning chanted then I heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which made me no less eager to turn round;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spirits saw I walking through the flame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore I looked, to my own steps and theirs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Apportioning my sight from time to time.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the close which to that hymn is made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aloud they shouted, “<i xml:lang="la">Virum non cognosco</i>”;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1035" id="noteref-1035" epub:type="noteref">1035</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then recommenced the hymn with voices low.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This also ended, cried they: “To the wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Diana ran, and drove forth Helice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1036" id="noteref-1036" epub:type="noteref">1036</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefrom, who had of Venus felt the poison.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then to their song returned they; then the wives</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They shouted, and the husbands who were chaste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I believe that them this mode suffices,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all the time the fire is burning them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such care is it needful, and such food,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the last wound of all should be closed up.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We went upon our way, oft the good Master</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the right shoulder smote me now the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, raying out, already the whole west<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1038" id="noteref-1038" epub:type="noteref">1038</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Changed from its azure aspect into white.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with my shadow did I make the flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appear more red; and even to such a sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shades saw I many, as they went, give heed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This was the cause that gave them a beginning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To speak of me; and to themselves began they</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To say: “That seems not a factitious body!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1039" id="noteref-1039" epub:type="noteref">1039</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then towards me, as far as they could come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came certain of them, always with regard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not to step forth where they would not be burned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou who goest, not from being slower</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But reverent perhaps, behind the others,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Answer me, who in thirst and fire am burning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor to me only is thine answer needful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all of these have greater thirst for it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us how is it that thou makest thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A wall unto the sun, as if thou hadst not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Entered as yet into the net of death.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus one of them addressed me, and I straight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should have revealed myself, were I not bent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On other novelty that then appeared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For through the middle of the burning road</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There came a people face to face with these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which held me in suspense with gazing at them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There see I hastening upon either side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each of the shades, and kissing one another</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without a pause, content with brief salute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus in the middle of their brown battalions</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance to spy their journey or their fortune.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No sooner is the friendly greeting ended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever the first footstep passes onward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each one endeavors to outcry the other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The new-come people: “Sodom and Gomorrah!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rest: “Into the cow Pasiphae enters,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1040" id="noteref-1040" epub:type="noteref">1040</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the bull unto her lust may run!”</span>

					<span>And close to me approached, even as before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The very same who had entreated me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Attent to listen in their countenance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, who their inclination twice had seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began: “O souls secure in the possession,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whene’er it may be, of a state of peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neither unripe nor ripened have remained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My members upon earth, but here are with me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With their own blood and their articulations.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I go up here to be no longer blind;</span>

					<span class="i1">Whereby the mortal through your world I bring.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which full of love is, and most amply spreads,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me, that I again in books may write it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who are you, and what is that multitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which goes upon its way behind your backs?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not otherwise with wonder is bewildered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mountaineer, and staring round is dumb,</span>

					<span class="i1">When rough and rustic to the town he goes,</span>

					<span>Than every shade became in its appearance;</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He recommenced who first had questioned us,</span>

					<span class="i1">“Experience freightest for a better life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The folk that comes not with us have offended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In that for which once Caesar, triumphing,</span>

					<span class="i1">I’m Guido Guinicelli, and now purge me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1046" id="noteref-1046" epub:type="noteref">1046</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Two sons became, their mother re-beholding,</span>

					<span class="i1">Such I became, but rise not to such height,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The moment I heard name himself the father</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of me and of my betters, who had ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And without speech and hearing thoughtfully</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For a long time I went, beholding him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I was fed with looking, utterly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Myself I offered ready for his service,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With affirmation that compels belief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Thou leavest footprints such</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In me, from what I hear, and so distinct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lethe cannot efface them, nor make dim.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if thy words just now the truth have sworn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell me what is the cause why thou displayest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In word and look that dear thou holdest me?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “Those dulcet lays of yours</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, long as shall endure our modern fashion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall make forever dear their very ink!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O brother,” said he, “he whom I point out,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And here he pointed at a spirit in front,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Was of the mother tongue a better smith.</span>

					<span>To clamor more than truth they turn their faces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in this way establish their opinion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere art or reason has by them been heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus many ancients with Guittone did,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1050" id="noteref-1050" epub:type="noteref">1050</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From cry to cry still giving him applause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the truth has conquered with most persons.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, if thou hast such ample privilege</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis granted thee to go unto the cloister</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where power of sinning is no longer ours.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, to give place perchance to one behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom he had near, he vanished in the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As fish in water going to the bottom.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In regions where his Maker shed his blood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1055" id="noteref-1055" epub:type="noteref">1055</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When the glad Angel of God appeared to us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Outside the flame he stood upon the verge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And chanted forth, “<i xml:lang="la">Beati mundo corde</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1056" id="noteref-1056" epub:type="noteref">1056</a></span>

					<span class="i1">If first the fire bite not; within it enter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And be not deaf unto the song beyond.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we were close beside him thus he said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore e’en such became I, when I heard him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he is who is put into the grave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon my clasped hands I straightened me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1057" id="noteref-1057" epub:type="noteref">1057</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Scanning the fire, and vividly recalling</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors,</span>

					<span class="i1">And unto me Virgilius said: “My son,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With thine own hands upon thy garment’s hem.</span>

					<span>Now lay aside, now lay aside all fear,</span>

					<span class="i1">And I still motionless, and ’gainst my conscience!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1059" id="noteref-1059" epub:type="noteref">1059</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat disturbed he said: “Now look thou, Son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1060" id="noteref-1060" epub:type="noteref">1060</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dying Pyramus, and gazed upon her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time the mulberry became vermilion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus, my obduracy being softened,</span>

					<span class="i1">I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in my memory evermore is welling.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat he wagged his head, and said: “How now?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall we stay on this side?” then smiled as one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Does at a child who’s vanquished by an apple.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then into the fire in front of me he entered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beseeching Statius to come after me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who a long way before divided us.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1061" id="noteref-1061" epub:type="noteref">1061</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I was in it, into molten glass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I would have cast me to refresh myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So without measure was the burning there!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my sweet Father, to encourage me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “Her eyes I seem to see already!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A voice, that on the other side was singing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Directed us, and we, attent alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On that, came forth where the ascent began.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">Venite, benedicti Patris mei</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1062" id="noteref-1062" epub:type="noteref">1062</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sounded within a splendor, which was there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such it o’ercame me, and I could not look.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The sun departs,” it added, “and night cometh;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So long as yet the west becomes not dark.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Straight forward through the rock the path ascended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In such a way that I cut off the rays</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before me of the sun, that now was low.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of few stairs we yet had made assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere by the vanished shadow the sun’s setting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind us we perceived, I and my Sages.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ere in all its parts immeasurable<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1063" id="noteref-1063" epub:type="noteref">1063</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The horizon of one aspect had become,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Night her boundless dispensation held,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each of us of a stair had made his bed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because the nature of the mount took from us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The power of climbing, more than the delight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as in ruminating passive grow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The goats, who have been swift and venturesome</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Passes the night beside his quiet flock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such at that hour were we, all three of us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Little could there be seen of things without;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But through that little I beheld the stars</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More luminous and larger than their wont.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1064" id="noteref-1064" epub:type="noteref">1064</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus ruminating, and beholding these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sleep seized upon me⁠—sleep, that oftentimes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before a deed is done has tidings of it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1065" id="noteref-1065" epub:type="noteref">1065</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was the hour, I think, when from the East</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First on the mountain Citherea beamed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1066" id="noteref-1066" epub:type="noteref">1066</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with the fire of love seems always burning;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw a lady walking in a meadow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Know whosoever may my name demand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1067" id="noteref-1067" epub:type="noteref">1067</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I am Leah, and go moving round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To please me at the mirror, here I deck me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But never does my sister Rachel leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I am to adorn me with my hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now before the antelucan splendors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The darkness fled away on every side,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1068" id="noteref-1068" epub:type="noteref">1068</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing already the great Masters risen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That apple sweet, which through so many branches<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1069" id="noteref-1069" epub:type="noteref">1069</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Today shall put in peace thy hungerings.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As these made use; and never were there guerdons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That could in pleasantness compare with these.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such longing upon longing came upon me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be above, that at each step thereafter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For flight I felt in me the pinions growing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When underneath us was the stairway all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Run o’er, and we were on the highest step,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “The temporal fire and the eternal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Son, thou hast seen, and to a place art come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where of myself no farther I discern.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By intellect and art I here have brought thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of itself alone this land produces.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which weeping caused me to come unto thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Expect no more or word or sign from me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And error were it not to do its bidding;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee o’er thyself I therefore crown and mitre!”</span>

					<span class="i1">Singing and culling floweret after floweret,</span>

					<span>As turns herself, with feet together pressed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the ground, a lady who is dancing,</span>

					<span class="i1">And hardly puts one foot before the other,</span>

					<span>And my entreaties made to be content,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So near approaching, that the dulcet sound</span>

					<span class="i1">Came unto me together with its meaning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as she was where the grasses are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think there shone so great a light</span>

					<span class="i1">Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1076" id="noteref-1076" epub:type="noteref">1076</a></span>

					<span class="i1">By her own son, beyond his usual custom!</span>

					<span>Erect upon the other bank she smiled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bearing full many colors in her hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which that high land produces without seed.</span>

					<span>Apart three paces did the river make us;</span>

					<span class="i1">But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across,</span>

					<span>More hatred from Leander did not suffer</span>

					<span>“Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,”</span>

					<span>“The water,” said I, “and the forest’s sound,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Whence she: “I will relate how from its cause</span>

					<span class="i1">(Which far as may be follow after heat,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Might not upon mankind wage any war,</span>

					<span>Now since the universal atmosphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turns in a circuit with the primal motion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless the circle is broken on some side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this height, that all is disengaged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In living ether, doth this motion strike</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And make the forest sound, for it is dense;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so much power the stricken plant possesses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with its virtue it impregns the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this, revolving, scatters it around;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yonder earth, according as ’tis worthy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In self or in its clime, conceives and bears</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of divers qualities the divers trees;</span>

					<span>It should not seem a marvel then on earth,</span>

					<span class="i1">This being heard, whenever any plant</span>

					<span class="i1">Without seed manifest there taketh root.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou must know, this holy table-land</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which thou art is full of every seed,</span>

					<span class="i1">And fruit has in it never gathered there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The water which thou seest springs not from vein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Restored by vapor that the cold condenses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But issues from a fountain safe and certain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which by the will of God as much regains</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it discharges, open on two sides.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this side with virtue it descends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which takes away all memory of sin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On that, of every good deed done restores it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here Lethe, as upon the other side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eunoë, it is called; and worketh not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If first on either side it be not tasted.</span>

					<span class="i1">And notwithstanding slaked so far may be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll give thee a corollary still in grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those who in ancient times have feigned in song</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Age of Gold and its felicity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here was the human race in innocence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This is the nectar of which each one speaks.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then backward did I turn me wholly round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1082" id="noteref-1082" epub:type="noteref">1082</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She, with the ending of her words, continued:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata.</i>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1084" id="noteref-1084" epub:type="noteref">1084</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One to avoid and one to see the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She then against the stream moved onward, going</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the bank, and I abreast of her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her little steps with little steps attending.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1085" id="noteref-1085" epub:type="noteref">1085</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When equally the margins gave a turn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In such a way, that to the East I faced.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor even thus our way continued far</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the lady wholly turned herself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto me, saying, “Brother, look and listen!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! a sudden lustre ran across</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On every side athwart the spacious forest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since the lightning ceases as it comes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that continuing brightened more and more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within my thought I said, “What thing is this?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a delicious melody there ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For there where earth and heaven obedient were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The woman only, and but just created,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could not endure to stay ’neath any veil;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I sooner should have tasted those delights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ineffable, and for a longer time.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While ’mid such manifold first-fruits I walked</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And still solicitous of more delights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In front of us like an enkindled fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with her choir Urania must assist me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1086" id="noteref-1086" epub:type="noteref">1086</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To put in verse things difficult to think.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little farther on, seven trees of gold</span>

					<span class="i1">In semblance the long space still intervening</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">The common object, which the sense deceives,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1087" id="noteref-1087" epub:type="noteref">1087</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lost not by distance any of its marks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The faculty that lends discourse to reason<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1088" id="noteref-1088" epub:type="noteref">1088</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1089" id="noteref-1089" epub:type="noteref">1089</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the voices of the song “Hosanna!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above them flamed the harness beautiful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far brighter than the moon in the serene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of midnight, at the middle of her month.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I turned me round, with admiration filled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To good Virgilius, and he answered me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With visage no less full of wonderment.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then back I turned my face to those high things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lady chid me: “Why dost thou burn only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So with affection for the living lights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dost not look at what comes after them?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Coming behind them, garmented in white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And such a whiteness never was on earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The water on my left flank was resplendent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And back to me reflected my left side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’en as a mirror, if I looked therein.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I upon my margin had such post</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nothing but the stream divided us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Better to see I gave my steps repose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I beheld the flamelets onward go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that it overhead remained distinct</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence the sun’s bow is made, and Delia’s girdle.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1090" id="noteref-1090" epub:type="noteref">1090</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>These standards to the rearward longer were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ten paces were the outermost apart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under so fair a heaven as I describe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The four and twenty Elders, two by two,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1091" id="noteref-1091" epub:type="noteref">1091</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all of them were singing: “Blessed thou<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1092" id="noteref-1092" epub:type="noteref">1092</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For evermore shall be thy loveliness.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the flowers and other tender grasses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In front of me upon the other margin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were disencumbered of that race elect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as in heaven star followeth after star,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There came close after them four animals,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1093" id="noteref-1093" epub:type="noteref">1093</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Plumed with six wings was every one of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If they were living would be such as these.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I in this cannot be prodigal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1094" id="noteref-1094" epub:type="noteref">1094</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he beheld them from the region cold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such were they here; saving that in their plumage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">John is with me, and differeth from him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1095" id="noteref-1095" epub:type="noteref">1095</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The interval between these four contained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A chariot triumphal on two wheels,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1096" id="noteref-1096" epub:type="noteref">1096</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which by a Griffin’s neck came drawn along;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1097" id="noteref-1097" epub:type="noteref">1097</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And upward he extended both his wings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between the middle list and three and three,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1098" id="noteref-1098" epub:type="noteref">1098</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he injured none by cleaving it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So high they rose that they were lost to sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And white the others with vermilion mingled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only Rome with no such splendid car</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But poor to it that of the Sun would be⁠—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1099" id="noteref-1099" epub:type="noteref">1099</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the importunate orison of Earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Jove was so mysteriously just.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1100" id="noteref-1100" epub:type="noteref">1100</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1101" id="noteref-1101" epub:type="noteref">1101</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came onward dancing; one so very red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in the fire she hardly had been noted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The second was as if her flesh and bones</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had all been fashioned out of emerald;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now they seemed conducted by the white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now by the red, and from the song of her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The others took their step, or slow or swift.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the left hand four made holiday<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1102" id="noteref-1102" epub:type="noteref">1102</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vested in purple, following the measure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of one of them with three eyes in her head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In rear of all the group here treated of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1103" id="noteref-1103" epub:type="noteref">1103</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But like in gait, each dignified and grave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One showed himself as one of the disciples<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1104" id="noteref-1104" epub:type="noteref">1104</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made for the animals she holds most dear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Contrary care the other manifested,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1105" id="noteref-1105" epub:type="noteref">1105</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Terror to me on this side of the river.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1106" id="noteref-1106" epub:type="noteref">1106</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And behind all an aged man alone<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1107" id="noteref-1107" epub:type="noteref">1107</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Walking in sleep with countenance acute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And like the foremost company these seven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No garland round about the head they wore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At little distance would the sight have sworn</span>
					<br/>

					<span>When the Septentrion of the highest heaven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1109" id="noteref-1109" epub:type="noteref">1109</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Which never either setting knew or rising,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor veil of other cloud than that of sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And which made everyone therein aware</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his own duty, as the lower makes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoever turns the helm to come to port)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Motionless halted, the veracious people,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That came at first between it and the Griffin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned themselves to the car, as to their peace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Singing, “<i xml:lang="la">Veni, sponsa, de Libano</i>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1110" id="noteref-1110" epub:type="noteref">1110</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shouted three times, and all the others after.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the Blessed at the final summons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uplifting light the reinvested flesh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So upon that celestial chariot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A hundred rose <i xml:lang="la">ad vocem tanti senis</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1111" id="noteref-1111" epub:type="noteref">1111</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ministers and messengers of life eternal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all were saying, “<i xml:lang="la">Benedictus qui venis</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1112" id="noteref-1112" epub:type="noteref">1112</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, scattering flowers above and round about,</span>

					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Manibus o date lilia plenis.</i>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1113" id="noteref-1113" epub:type="noteref">1113</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere now have I beheld, as day began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the sun’s face, uprising, overshadowed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1114" id="noteref-1114" epub:type="noteref">1114</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that by tempering influence of vapors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For a long interval the eye sustained it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which from those hands angelical ascended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And downward fell again inside and out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over her snow-white veil with olive cinct</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appeared a lady under a green mantle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1115" id="noteref-1115" epub:type="noteref">1115</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vested in color of the living flame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my own spirit, that already now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So long a time had been, that in her presence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1116" id="noteref-1116" epub:type="noteref">1116</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1117" id="noteref-1117" epub:type="noteref">1117</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without more knowledge having by mine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through occult virtue that from her proceeded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of ancient love the mighty influence felt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as on my vision smote the power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sublime, that had already pierced me through</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the left hand I turned with that reliance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which the little child runs to his mother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To say unto Virgilius: “Not a drachm</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I know the traces of the ancient flame.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1118" id="noteref-1118" epub:type="noteref">1118</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But us Virgilius of himself deprived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1119" id="noteref-1119" epub:type="noteref">1119</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Availed my cheeks now purified from dew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That weeping they should not again be darkened.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Dante, because Virgilius has departed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For by another sword thou need’st must weep.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en as an admiral, who on poop and prow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comes to behold the people that are working</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the left hand border of the car,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When at the sound I turned of my own name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of necessity is here recorded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Veiled underneath the angelic festival,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Direct her eyes to me across the river.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although the veil, that from her head descended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Encircled with the foliage of Minerva,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did not permit her to appear distinctly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In attitude still royally majestic</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Continued she, like unto one who speaks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Look at me well; in sooth I’m Beatrice!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Didst thou not know that man is happy here?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So great a shame did weigh my forehead down.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to the son the mother seems superb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tasteth the savor of severe compassion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silent became she, and the Angels sang</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suddenly, “<i xml:lang="la">In te, Domine, speravi</i>”:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1120" id="noteref-1120" epub:type="noteref">1120</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But beyond <i xml:lang="la">pedes meos</i> did not pass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the snow among the living rafters<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1121" id="noteref-1121" epub:type="noteref">1121</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the back of Italy congeals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1122" id="noteref-1122" epub:type="noteref">1122</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then, dissolving, trickles through itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whene’er the land that loses shadow breathes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en thus was I without a tear or sigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the song of those who sing forever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After the music of the eternal spheres.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when I heard in their sweet melodies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Compassion for me, more than had they said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ice, that was about my heart congealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To air and water changed, and in my anguish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She, on the right-hand border of the car</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still firmly standing, to those holy beings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus her discourse directed afterwards:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One step the ages make upon their path;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore my answer is with greater care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the sin and dole be of one measure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only by the work of those great wheels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That destine every seed unto some end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According as the stars are in conjunction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by the largess of celestial graces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which have such lofty vapors for their rain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1123" id="noteref-1123" epub:type="noteref">1123</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That near to them our sight approaches not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such had this man become in his new life</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Potentially, that every righteous habit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would have made admirable proof in him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But so much more malignant and more savage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more good earthly vigor it possesses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some time did I sustain him with my look;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I led him with me turned in the right way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as ever of my second age</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I was upon the threshold and changed life,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1124" id="noteref-1124" epub:type="noteref">1124</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himself from me he took and gave to others.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And beauty and virtue were in me increased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I was to him less dear and less delightful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And into ways untrue he turned his steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pursuing the false images of good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never any promises fulfil;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By means of which in dreams and otherwise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I called him back, so little did he heed them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So low he fell, that all appliances<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1125" id="noteref-1125" epub:type="noteref">1125</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his salvation were already short,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save showing him the people of perdition.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For this I visited the gates of death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And unto him, who so far up has led him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My intercessions were with weeping borne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God’s lofty fiat would be violated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should tasted be, withouten any scot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of penitence, that gushes forth in tears.”</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turning to me the point of her discourse,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1127" id="noteref-1127" epub:type="noteref">1127</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She recommenced, continuing without pause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy own confession needs must be conjoined.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My faculties were in so great confusion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than by its organs it was set at large.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awhile she waited; then she said: “What thinkest?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Answer me; for the mournful memories</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In thee not yet are by the waters injured.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Confusion and dismay together mingled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was needful to the understanding of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as a cross-bow breaks, when ’tis discharged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with less force the arrow hits the mark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence she to me: “In those desires of mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which led thee to the loving of that good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What trenches lying traverse or what chains<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1128" id="noteref-1128" epub:type="noteref">1128</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Didst thou discover, that of passing onward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what allurements or what vantages</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the forehead of the others showed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1129" id="noteref-1129" epub:type="noteref">1129</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the heaving of a bitter sigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hardly had I the voice to make response,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping I said: “The things that present were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soon as your countenance concealed itself.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she: “Shouldst thou be silent, or deny</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What thou confessest, not less manifest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would be thy fault, by such a Judge ’tis known.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when from one’s own cheeks comes bursting forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1130" id="noteref-1130" epub:type="noteref">1130</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thy transgression, and another time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1131" id="noteref-1131" epub:type="noteref">1131</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My buried flesh should have directed thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never to thee presented art or nature</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason of my death, what mortal thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should then have drawn thee into its desire?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of things fallacious to have risen up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To follow me, who was no longer such.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wait for further blows, or little girl,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1132" id="noteref-1132" epub:type="noteref">1132</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or other vanity of such brief use.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The callow birdlet waits for two or three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to the eyes of those already fledged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1133" id="noteref-1133" epub:type="noteref">1133</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as children silent in their shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And conscious of their fault, and penitent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was I standing; and she said: “If thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With less resistance is a robust holm</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uprooted, either by a native wind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1134" id="noteref-1134" epub:type="noteref">1134</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than I upraised at her command my chin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when she by the beard the face demanded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as my countenance was lifted up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1135" id="noteref-1135" epub:type="noteref">1135</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, still but little reassured, mine eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is one person only in two natures.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She seemed to me far more her ancient self</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To excel, than others here, when she was here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of all other things the one which turned me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most to its love became the most my foe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such self-conviction stung me at the heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’erpowered I fell, and what I then became</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lady I had found alone, above me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1136" id="noteref-1136" epub:type="noteref">1136</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw, and she was saying, “Hold me, hold me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, dragging me behind her, she was moving<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1137" id="noteref-1137" epub:type="noteref">1137</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I was near unto the blessed shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Asperges me</i>,” I heard so sweetly sung,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1138" id="noteref-1138" epub:type="noteref">1138</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remember it I cannot, much less write it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where I was forced to swallow of the water.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the dance of the four beautiful,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1139" id="noteref-1139" epub:type="noteref">1139</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And each one with her arm did cover me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1140" id="noteref-1140" epub:type="noteref">1140</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere Beatrice descended to the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We as her handmaids were appointed her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We’ll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The three beyond, who more profoundly look.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1141" id="noteref-1141" epub:type="noteref">1141</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus singing they began; and afterwards</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Griffin’s breast they led me with them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1142" id="noteref-1142" epub:type="noteref">1142</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“See that thou dost not spare thine eyes,” they said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1143" id="noteref-1143" epub:type="noteref">1143</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in a glass the sun, not otherwise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within them was the twofold monster shining,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1144" id="noteref-1144" epub:type="noteref">1144</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now with the one, now with the other nature.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1145" id="noteref-1145" epub:type="noteref">1145</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I beheld the thing itself stand still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in its image it transformed itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While with amazement filled and jubilant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My soul was tasting of the food, that while</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Themselves revealing of the highest rank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In bearing, did the other three advance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Singing to their angelic saraband.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1146" id="noteref-1146" epub:type="noteref">1146</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such was their song, “unto thy faithful one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who has to see thee ta’en so many steps.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In grace do us the grace that thou unveil</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy face to him, so that he may discern</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The second beauty which thou dost conceal.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O splendor of the living light eternal!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would not seem to have his mind encumbered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where the harmonious heaven o’ershadowed thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When in the open air thou didst unveil?</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In satisfying their decennial thirst,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1148" id="noteref-1148" epub:type="noteref">1148</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all my other senses were extinct,</span>

					<span>And upon this side and on that they had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Walls of indifference, so the holy smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew them unto itself with the old net;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When forcibly my sight was turned away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards my left hand by those goddesses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because I heard from them a “Too intently!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that condition of the sight which is<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1149" id="noteref-1149" epub:type="noteref">1149</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In eyes but lately smitten by the sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bereft me of my vision some short while;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to the less when sight reshaped itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I say the less in reference to the greater</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Splendor from which perforce I had withdrawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw upon its right wing wheeled about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The glorious host returning with the sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As underneath its shields, to save itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A squadron turns, and with its banner wheels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the whole thereof can change its front,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That soldiery of the celestial kingdom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the chariot had turned its pole.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the Griffin moved his burden benedight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But so that not a feather of him fluttered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lady fair who drew me through the ford</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Followed with Statius and myself the wheel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which made its orbit with the lesser arc.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So passing through the lofty forest, vacant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By fault of her who in the serpent trusted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Angelic music made our steps keep time.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perchance as great a space had in three flights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An arrow loosened from the string o’erpassed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1150" id="noteref-1150" epub:type="noteref">1150</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As we had moved when Beatrice descended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard them murmur altogether, “Adam!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then circled they about a tree despoiled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1151" id="noteref-1151" epub:type="noteref">1151</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its tresses, which so much the more dilate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As higher they ascend, had been by Indians<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1152" id="noteref-1152" epub:type="noteref">1152</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among their forests marvelled at for height.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1153" id="noteref-1153" epub:type="noteref">1153</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since appetite by this was turned to evil.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After this fashion round the tree robust</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The others shouted; and the twofold creature:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Thus is preserved the seed of all the just.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turning to the pole which he had dragged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what was of it unto it left bound.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1154" id="noteref-1154" epub:type="noteref">1154</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the same manner as our trees (when downward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Falls the great light, with that together mingled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which after the celestial Lasca shines)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1155" id="noteref-1155" epub:type="noteref">1155</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Begin to swell, and then renew themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each one with its own color, ere the Sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Harness his steeds beneath another star:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1156" id="noteref-1156" epub:type="noteref">1156</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Less than of rose and more than violet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I never heard, nor here below is sung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hymn which afterward that people sang,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor did I bear the melody throughout.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had I the power to paint how fell asleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1157" id="noteref-1157" epub:type="noteref">1157</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as a painter who from model paints</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I would portray how I was lulled asleep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He may, who well can picture drowsihood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I pass to what time I awoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And say a splendor rent from me the veil</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of slumber, and a calling: “Rise, what dost thou?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to behold the apple-tree in blossom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1158" id="noteref-1158" epub:type="noteref">1158</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Peter and John and James conducted were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, overcome, recovered at the word<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1159" id="noteref-1159" epub:type="noteref">1159</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which still greater slumbers have been broken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw their school diminished by the loss</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not only of Elias, but of Moses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the apparel of their Master changed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I revived, and saw that piteous one<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1160" id="noteref-1160" epub:type="noteref">1160</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above me standing, who had been conductress</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aforetime of my steps beside the river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all in doubt I said, “Where’s Beatrice?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And she: “Behold her seated underneath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The leafage new, upon the root of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold the company that circles her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rest behind the Griffin are ascending</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With more melodious song, and more profound.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because already in my sight was she</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alone she sat upon the very earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Left there as guardian of the chariot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Encircling her, a cloister made themselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1161" id="noteref-1161" epub:type="noteref">1161</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Short while shalt thou be here a forester,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou shalt be with me for evermore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore, for that world’s good which liveth ill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having returned to earth, take heed thou write.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of her commandments all devoted was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My mind and eyes directed where she willed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never descended with so swift a motion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From out the region which is most remote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I beheld the bird of Jove descend<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1162" id="noteref-1162" epub:type="noteref">1162</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down through the tree, rending away the bark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As well as blossoms and the foliage new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he with all his might the chariot smote,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1163" id="noteref-1163" epub:type="noteref">1163</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter saw I leap into the body</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1164" id="noteref-1164" epub:type="noteref">1164</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Lady put him to as swift a flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then by the way that it before had come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the chariot’s chest I saw the Eagle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1165" id="noteref-1165" epub:type="noteref">1165</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such as issues from a heart that mourns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1166" id="noteref-1166" epub:type="noteref">1166</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drawing unto himself his tail malign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That which remained behind, even as with grass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A fertile region, with the feathers, offered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps with pure intention and benign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The pole and both the wheels so speedily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Transfigured thus the holy edifice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three on the pole and one at either corner.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1167" id="noteref-1167" epub:type="noteref">1167</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first were horned like oxen; but the four</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had but a single horn upon the forehead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A monster such had never yet been seen!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seated upon it, there appeared to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1168" id="noteref-1168" epub:type="noteref">1168</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as if not to have her taken from him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upright beside her I beheld a giant;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1169" id="noteref-1169" epub:type="noteref">1169</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ever and anon they kissed each other.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But because she her wanton, roving eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned upon me, her angry paramour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1170" id="noteref-1170" epub:type="noteref">1170</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He loosed the monster, and across the forest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dragged it so far, he made of that alone<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1171" id="noteref-1171" epub:type="noteref">1171</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.</span>

					<span class="i1">Now three, now four, melodious psalmody</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The maidens in the midst of tears began;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Listened to them with such a countenance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when the other virgins place had given<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1173" id="noteref-1173" epub:type="noteref">1173</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For her to speak, uprisen to her feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With color as of fire, she made response:</span>

					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">Modicum, et non videbitis me</i>;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1174" id="noteref-1174" epub:type="noteref">1174</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Then all the seven in front of her she placed;</span>

					<span class="i1">And after her, by beckoning only, moved</span>

					<span>So she moved onward; and I do not think</span>

					<span class="i1">That her tenth step was placed upon the ground,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>As soon as I was with her as I should be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She said to me: “Why, brother, dost thou not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Venture to question now, in coming with me?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As unto those who are too reverential,</span>

					<span class="i1">Began I: “My necessity, Madonna,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">You know, and that which thereunto is good.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she to me: “Of fear and bashfulness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.</span>

					<span>Know that the vessel which the serpent broke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1177" id="noteref-1177" epub:type="noteref">1177</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was, and is not; but let him who is guilty</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Think that God’s vengeance does not fear a sop.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1178" id="noteref-1178" epub:type="noteref">1178</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without an heir shall not forever be<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1179" id="noteref-1179" epub:type="noteref">1179</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence it became a monster, then a prey;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For verily I see, and hence narrate it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The stars already near to bring the time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From every hindrance safe, and every bar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1180" id="noteref-1180" epub:type="noteref">1180</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that same giant who is sinning with her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And peradventure my dark utterance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1181" id="noteref-1181" epub:type="noteref">1181</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But soon the facts shall be the Naiades<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1182" id="noteref-1182" epub:type="noteref">1182</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who shall this difficult enigma solve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without destruction of the flocks and harvests.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Note thou; and even as by me are uttered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These words, so teach them unto those who live</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That life which is a running unto death;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1183" id="noteref-1183" epub:type="noteref">1183</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bear in mind, whene’er thou writest them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That twice already has been pillaged here.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1184" id="noteref-1184" epub:type="noteref">1184</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoever pillages or shatters it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With blasphemy of deed offendeth God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who made it holy for his use alone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For biting that, in pain and in desire<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1185" id="noteref-1185" epub:type="noteref">1185</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Five thousand years and more the first-born soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For special reason so pre-eminent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In height, and so inverted in its summit.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1186" id="noteref-1186" epub:type="noteref">1186</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if thy vain imaginings had not been</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Water of Elsa round about thy mind,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1187" id="noteref-1187" epub:type="noteref">1187</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1188" id="noteref-1188" epub:type="noteref">1188</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou by so many circumstances only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The justice of the interdict of God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since I see thee in thine intellect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Converted into stone and stained with sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will too, if not written, at least painted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That cinct with palm the pilgrim’s staff is borne.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1189" id="noteref-1189" epub:type="noteref">1189</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “As by a signet is the wax</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My brain is now imprinted by yourself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But wherefore so beyond my power of sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soars your desirable discourse, that aye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That thou mayst recognize,” she said, “the school<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1190" id="noteref-1190" epub:type="noteref">1190</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its doctrine follows after my discourse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mayst behold your path from the divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Distant as far as separated is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From earth the heaven that highest hastens on.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence her I answered: “I do not remember</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever I estranged myself from you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And if thou art not able to remember,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smiling she answered, “recollect thee now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if from smoke a fire may be inferred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truly from this time forward shall my words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be naked, so far as it is befitting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To lay them open unto thy rude gaze.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And more coruscant and with slower steps</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sun was holding the meridian circle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1191" id="noteref-1191" epub:type="noteref">1191</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When halted (as he cometh to a halt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who goes before a squadron as its escort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If something new he find upon his way)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The maidens seven at a dark shadow’s edge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Alp upon its frigid border wears.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1192" id="noteref-1192" epub:type="noteref">1192</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And slowly part, like friends, from one another.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O light, O glory of the human race!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What stream is this which here unfolds itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From out one source, and from itself withdraws?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For such a prayer, ’twas said unto me, “Pray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Matilda that she tell thee”; and here answered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one does who doth free himself from blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beautiful lady: “This and other things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were told to him by me; and sure I am</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The water of Lethe has not hid them from him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Beatrice: “Perhaps a greater care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which oftentimes our memory takes away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has made the vision of his mind obscure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Eunoë behold, that yonder rises;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1193" id="noteref-1193" epub:type="noteref">1193</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Revive again the half-dead virtue in him.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1194" id="noteref-1194" epub:type="noteref">1194</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But makes its own will of another’s will</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even so, when she had taken hold of me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said, in her womanly manner, “Come with him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If, Reader, I possessed a longer space</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For writing it, I yet would sing in part</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the sweet draught that ne’er would satiate me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But inasmuch as full are all the leaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made ready for this second canticle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The curb of art no farther lets me go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the most holy water I returned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Regenerate, in the manner of new trees</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That are renewed with a new foliage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1195" id="noteref-1195" epub:type="noteref">1195</a></span>
