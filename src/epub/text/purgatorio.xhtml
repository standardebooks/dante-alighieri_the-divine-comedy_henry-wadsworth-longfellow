			<h2>Purgatorio</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto I</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">To run o'er better waters hoists its sail<br/>
			The little vessel of my genius now,<br/>
			That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;</p>
			<p>And of that second kingdom will I sing<br/>
			Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,<br/>
			And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.</p>
			<p>But let dead Poesy here rise again,<br/>
			O holy Muses, since that I am yours,<br/>
			And here Calliope somewhat ascend,</p>
			<p>My song accompanying with that sound,<br/>
			Of which the miserable magpies felt<br/>
			The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.</p>
			<p>Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire,<br/>
			That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect<br/>
			Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,</p>
			<p>Unto mine eyes did recommence delight<br/>
			Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,<br/>
			Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.</p>
			<p>The beauteous planet, that to love incites,<br/>
			Was making all the orient to laugh,<br/>
			Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.</p>
			<p>To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind<br/>
			Upon the other pole, and saw four stars<br/>
			Ne'er seen before save by the primal people.</p>
			<p>Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.<br/>
			O thou septentrional and widowed site,<br/>
			Because thou art deprived of seeing these!</p>
			<p>When from regarding them I had withdrawn,<br/>
			Turning a little to the other pole,<br/>
			There where the Wain had disappeared already,</p>
			<p>I saw beside me an old man alone,<br/>
			Worthy of so much reverence in his look,<br/>
			That more owes not to father any son.</p>
			<p>A long beard and with white hair intermingled<br/>
			He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,<br/>
			Of which a double list fell on his breast.</p>
			<p>The rays of the four consecrated stars<br/>
			Did so adorn his countenance with light,<br/>
			That him I saw as were the sun before him.</p>
			<p>"Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,<br/>
			Have fled away from the eternal prison?"<br/>
			Moving those venerable plumes, he said:</p>
			<p>"Who guided you? or who has been your lamp<br/>
			In issuing forth out of the night profound,<br/>
			That ever black makes the infernal valley?</p>
			<p>The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?<br/>
			Or is there changed in heaven some council new,<br/>
			That being damned ye come unto my crags?"</p>
			<p>Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,<br/>
			And with his words, and with his hands and signs,<br/>
			Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;</p>
			<p>Then answered him: "I came not of myself;<br/>
			A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers<br/>
			I aided this one with my company.</p>
			<p>But since it is thy will more be unfolded<br/>
			Of our condition, how it truly is,<br/>
			Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.</p>
			<p>This one has never his last evening seen,<br/>
			But by his folly was so near to it<br/>
			That very little time was there to turn.</p>
			<p>As I have said, I unto him was sent<br/>
			To rescue him, and other way was none<br/>
			Than this to which I have myself betaken.</p>
			<p>I've shown him all the people of perdition,<br/>
			And now those spirits I intend to show<br/>
			Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.</p>
			<p>How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.<br/>
			Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me<br/>
			To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.</p>
			<p>Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;<br/>
			He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,<br/>
			As knoweth he who life for her refuses.</p>
			<p>Thou know'st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter<br/>
			Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave<br/>
			The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.</p>
			<p>By us the eternal edicts are not broken;<br/>
			Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;<br/>
			But of that circle I, where are the chaste</p>
			<p>Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,<br/>
			O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;<br/>
			For her love, then, incline thyself to us.</p>
			<p>Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;<br/>
			I will take back this grace from thee to her,<br/>
			If to be mentioned there below thou deignest."</p>
			<p>"Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes<br/>
			While I was on the other side," then said he,<br/>
			"That every grace she wished of me I granted;</p>
			<p>Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,<br/>
			She can no longer move me, by that law<br/>
			Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.</p>
			<p>But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,<br/>
			As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;<br/>
			Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.</p>
			<p>Go, then, and see thou gird this one about<br/>
			With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,<br/>
			So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,</p>
			<p>For 'twere not fitting that the eye o'ercast<br/>
			By any mist should go before the first<br/>
			Angel, who is of those of Paradise.</p>
			<p>This little island round about its base<br/>
			Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,<br/>
			Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;</p>
			<p>No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,<br/>
			Or that doth indurate, can there have life,<br/>
			Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.</p>
			<p>Thereafter be not this way your return;<br/>
			The sun, which now is rising, will direct you<br/>
			To take the mount by easier ascent."</p>
			<p>With this he vanished; and I raised me up<br/>
			Without a word, and wholly drew myself<br/>
			Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.</p>
			<p>And he began: "Son, follow thou my steps;<br/>
			Let us turn back, for on this side declines<br/>
			The plain unto its lower boundaries."</p>
			<p>The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour<br/>
			Which fled before it, so that from afar<br/>
			I recognised the trembling of the sea.</p>
			<p>Along the solitary plain we went<br/>
			As one who unto the lost road returns,<br/>
			And till he finds it seems to go in vain.</p>
			<p>As soon as we were come to where the dew<br/>
			Fights with the sun, and, being in a part<br/>
			Where shadow falls, little evaporates,</p>
			<p>Both of his hands upon the grass outspread<br/>
			In gentle manner did my Master place;<br/>
			Whence I, who of his action was aware,</p>
			<p>Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;<br/>
			There did he make in me uncovered wholly<br/>
			That hue which Hell had covered up in me.</p>
			<p>Then came we down upon the desert shore<br/>
			Which never yet saw navigate its waters<br/>
			Any that afterward had known return.</p>
			<p>There he begirt me as the other pleased;<br/>
			O marvellous! for even as he culled<br/>
			The humble plant, such it sprang up again</p>
			<p>Suddenly there where he uprooted it.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto II</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Already had the sun the horizon reached<br/>
			Whose circle of meridian covers o'er<br/>
			Jerusalem with its most lofty point,</p>
			<p>And night that opposite to him revolves<br/>
			Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales<br/>
			That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;</p>
			<p>So that the white and the vermilion cheeks<br/>
			Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,<br/>
			By too great age were changing into orange.</p>
			<p>We still were on the border of the sea,<br/>
			Like people who are thinking of their road,<br/>
			Who go in heart and with the body stay;</p>
			<p>And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,<br/>
			Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red<br/>
			Down in the West upon the ocean floor,</p>
			<p>Appeared to me—may I again behold it!—<br/>
			A light along the sea so swiftly coming,<br/>
			Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;</p>
			<p>From which when I a little had withdrawn<br/>
			Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,<br/>
			Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.</p>
			<p>Then on each side of it appeared to me<br/>
			I knew not what of white, and underneath it<br/>
			Little by little there came forth another.</p>
			<p>My Master yet had uttered not a word<br/>
			While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;<br/>
			But when he clearly recognised the pilot,</p>
			<p>He cried: "Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!<br/>
			Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!<br/>
			Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!</p>
			<p>See how he scorneth human arguments,<br/>
			So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail<br/>
			Than his own wings, between so distant shores.</p>
			<p>See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,<br/>
			Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,<br/>
			That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!"</p>
			<p>Then as still nearer and more near us came<br/>
			The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,<br/>
			So that near by the eye could not endure him,</p>
			<p>But down I cast it; and he came to shore<br/>
			With a small vessel, very swift and light,<br/>
			So that the water swallowed naught thereof.</p>
			<p>Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;<br/>
			Beatitude seemed written in his face,<br/>
			And more than a hundred spirits sat within.</p>
			<p>"In exitu Israel de Aegypto!"<br/>
			They chanted all together in one voice,<br/>
			With whatso in that psalm is after written.</p>
			<p>Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,<br/>
			Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,<br/>
			And he departed swiftly as he came.</p>
			<p>The throng which still remained there unfamiliar<br/>
			Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,<br/>
			As one who in new matters makes essay.</p>
			<p>On every side was darting forth the day.<br/>
			The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts<br/>
			From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,</p>
			<p>When the new people lifted up their faces<br/>
			Towards us, saying to us: "If ye know,<br/>
			Show us the way to go unto the mountain."</p>
			<p>And answer made Virgilius: "Ye believe<br/>
			Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,<br/>
			But we are strangers even as yourselves.</p>
			<p>Just now we came, a little while before you,<br/>
			Another way, which was so rough and steep,<br/>
			That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us."</p>
			<p>The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,<br/>
			Become aware that I was still alive,<br/>
			Pallid in their astonishment became;</p>
			<p>And as to messenger who bears the olive<br/>
			The people throng to listen to the news,<br/>
			And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,</p>
			<p>So at the sight of me stood motionless<br/>
			Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if<br/>
			Oblivious to go and make them fair.</p>
			<p>One from among them saw I coming forward,<br/>
			As to embrace me, with such great affection,<br/>
			That it incited me to do the like.</p>
			<p>O empty shadows, save in aspect only!<br/>
			Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,<br/>
			As oft returned with them to my own breast!</p>
			<p>I think with wonder I depicted me;<br/>
			Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;<br/>
			And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.</p>
			<p>Gently it said that I should stay my steps;<br/>
			Then knew I who it was, and I entreated<br/>
			That it would stop awhile to speak with me.</p>
			<p>It made reply to me: "Even as I loved thee<br/>
			In mortal body, so I love thee free;<br/>
			Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?"</p>
			<p>"My own Casella! to return once more<br/>
			There where I am, I make this journey," said I;<br/>
			"But how from thee has so much time be taken?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "No outrage has been done me,<br/>
			If he who takes both when and whom he pleases<br/>
			Has many times denied to me this passage,</p>
			<p>For of a righteous will his own is made.<br/>
			He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken<br/>
			Whoever wished to enter with all peace;</p>
			<p>Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore<br/>
			Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,<br/>
			Benignantly by him have been received.</p>
			<p>Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,<br/>
			Because for evermore assemble there<br/>
			Those who tow'rds Acheron do not descend."</p>
			<p>And I: "If some new law take not from thee<br/>
			Memory or practice of the song of love,<br/>
			Which used to quiet in me all my longings,</p>
			<p>Thee may it please to comfort therewithal<br/>
			Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body<br/>
			Hitherward coming is so much distressed."</p>
			<p>"Love, that within my mind discourses with me,"<br/>
			Forthwith began he so melodiously,<br/>
			The melody within me still is sounding.</p>
			<p>My Master, and myself, and all that people<br/>
			Which with him were, appeared as satisfied<br/>
			As if naught else might touch the mind of any.</p>
			<p>We all of us were moveless and attentive<br/>
			Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,<br/>
			Exclaiming: "What is this, ye laggard spirits?</p>
			<p>What negligence, what standing still is this?<br/>
			Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,<br/>
			That lets not God be manifest to you."</p>
			<p>Even as when, collecting grain or tares,<br/>
			The doves, together at their pasture met,<br/>
			Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,</p>
			<p>If aught appear of which they are afraid,<br/>
			Upon a sudden leave their food alone,<br/>
			Because they are assailed by greater care;</p>
			<p>So that fresh company did I behold<br/>
			The song relinquish, and go tow'rds the hill,<br/>
			As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;</p>
			<p>Nor was our own departure less in haste.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto III</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight<br/>
			Had scattered them asunder o'er the plain,<br/>
			Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,</p>
			<p>I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,<br/>
			And how without him had I kept my course?<br/>
			Who would have led me up along the mountain?</p>
			<p>He seemed to me within himself remorseful;<br/>
			O noble conscience, and without a stain,<br/>
			How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!</p>
			<p>After his feet had laid aside the haste<br/>
			Which mars the dignity of every act,<br/>
			My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,</p>
			<p>Let loose its faculties as if delighted,<br/>
			And I my sight directed to the hill<br/>
			That highest tow'rds the heaven uplifts itself.</p>
			<p>The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,<br/>
			Was broken in front of me into the figure<br/>
			Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;</p>
			<p>Unto one side I turned me, with the fear<br/>
			Of being left alone, when I beheld<br/>
			Only in front of me the ground obscured.</p>
			<p>"Why dost thou still mistrust?" my Comforter<br/>
			Began to say to me turned wholly round;<br/>
			"Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?</p>
			<p>'Tis evening there already where is buried<br/>
			The body within which I cast a shadow;<br/>
			'Tis from Brundusium ta'en, and Naples has it.</p>
			<p>Now if in front of me no shadow fall,<br/>
			Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,<br/>
			Because one ray impedeth not another</p>
			<p>To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,<br/>
			Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills<br/>
			That how it works be not unveiled to us.</p>
			<p>Insane is he who hopeth that our reason<br/>
			Can traverse the illimitable way,<br/>
			Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!</p>
			<p>Mortals, remain contented at the 'Quia;'<br/>
			For if ye had been able to see all,<br/>
			No need there were for Mary to give birth;</p>
			<p>And ye have seen desiring without fruit,<br/>
			Those whose desire would have been quieted,<br/>
			Which evermore is given them for a grief.</p>
			<p>I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,<br/>
			And many others;"—and here bowed his head,<br/>
			And more he said not, and remained disturbed.</p>
			<p>We came meanwhile unto the mountain's foot;<br/>
			There so precipitate we found the rock,<br/>
			That nimble legs would there have been in vain.</p>
			<p>'Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,<br/>
			The most secluded pathway is a stair<br/>
			Easy and open, if compared with that.</p>
			<p>"Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill<br/>
			Slopes down," my Master said, his footsteps staying,<br/>
			"So that who goeth without wings may mount?"</p>
			<p>And while he held his eyes upon the ground<br/>
			Examining the nature of the path,<br/>
			And I was looking up around the rock,</p>
			<p>On the left hand appeared to me a throng<br/>
			Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,<br/>
			And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.</p>
			<p>"Lift up thine eyes," I to the Master said;<br/>
			"Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,<br/>
			If thou of thine own self can have it not."</p>
			<p>Then he looked at me, and with frank expression<br/>
			Replied: "Let us go there, for they come slowly,<br/>
			And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son."</p>
			<p>Still was that people as far off from us,<br/>
			After a thousand steps of ours I say,<br/>
			As a good thrower with his hand would reach,</p>
			<p>When they all crowded unto the hard masses<br/>
			Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,<br/>
			As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.</p>
			<p>"O happy dead!  O spirits elect already!"<br/>
			Virgilius made beginning, "by that peace<br/>
			Which I believe is waiting for you all,</p>
			<p>Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,<br/>
			So that the going up be possible,<br/>
			For to lose time irks him most who most knows."</p>
			<p>As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold<br/>
			By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand<br/>
			Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,</p>
			<p>And what the foremost does the others do,<br/>
			Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,<br/>
			Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;</p>
			<p>So moving to approach us thereupon<br/>
			I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,<br/>
			Modest in face and dignified in gait.</p>
			<p>As soon as those in the advance saw broken<br/>
			The light upon the ground at my right side,<br/>
			So that from me the shadow reached the rock,</p>
			<p>They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;<br/>
			And all the others, who came after them,<br/>
			Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.</p>
			<p>"Without your asking, I confess to you<br/>
			This is a human body which you see,<br/>
			Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.</p>
			<p>Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded<br/>
			That not without a power which comes from Heaven<br/>
			Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall."</p>
			<p>The Master thus; and said those worthy people:<br/>
			"Return ye then, and enter in before us,"<br/>
			Making a signal with the back o' the hand</p>
			<p>And one of them began: "Whoe'er thou art,<br/>
			Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well<br/>
			If e'er thou saw me in the other world."</p>
			<p>I turned me tow'rds him, and looked at him closely;<br/>
			Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,<br/>
			But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.</p>
			<p>When with humility I had disclaimed<br/>
			E'er having seen him, "Now behold!" he said,<br/>
			And showed me high upon his breast a wound.</p>
			<p>Then said he with a smile: "I am Manfredi,<br/>
			The grandson of the Empress Costanza;<br/>
			Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee</p>
			<p>Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother<br/>
			Of Sicily's honour and of Aragon's,<br/>
			And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.</p>
			<p>After I had my body lacerated<br/>
			By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself<br/>
			Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.</p>
			<p>Horrible my iniquities had been;<br/>
			But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,<br/>
			That it receives whatever turns to it.</p>
			<p>Had but Cosenza's pastor, who in chase<br/>
			Of me was sent by Clement at that time,<br/>
			In God read understandingly this page,</p>
			<p>The bones of my dead body still would be<br/>
			At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,<br/>
			Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.</p>
			<p>Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,<br/>
			Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,<br/>
			Where he transported them with tapers quenched.</p>
			<p>By malison of theirs is not so lost<br/>
			Eternal Love, that it cannot return,<br/>
			So long as hope has anything of green.</p>
			<p>True is it, who in contumacy dies<br/>
			Of Holy Church, though penitent at last,<br/>
			Must wait upon the outside this bank</p>
			<p>Thirty times told the time that he has been<br/>
			In his presumption, unless such decree<br/>
			Shorter by means of righteous prayers become.</p>
			<p>See now if thou hast power to make me happy,<br/>
			By making known unto my good Costanza<br/>
			How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside,</p>
			<p>For those on earth can much advance us here."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto IV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Whenever by delight or else by pain,<br/>
			That seizes any faculty of ours,<br/>
			Wholly to that the soul collects itself,</p>
			<p>It seemeth that no other power it heeds;<br/>
			And this against that error is which thinks<br/>
			One soul above another kindles in us.</p>
			<p>And hence, whenever aught is heard or seen<br/>
			Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,<br/>
			Time passes on, and we perceive it not,</p>
			<p>Because one faculty is that which listens,<br/>
			And other that which the soul keeps entire;<br/>
			This is as if in bonds, and that is free.</p>
			<p>Of this I had experience positive<br/>
			In hearing and in gazing at that spirit;<br/>
			For fifty full degrees uprisen was</p>
			<p>The sun, and I had not perceived it, when<br/>
			We came to where those souls with one accord<br/>
			Cried out unto us: "Here is what you ask."</p>
			<p>A greater opening ofttimes hedges up<br/>
			With but a little forkful of his thorns<br/>
			The villager, what time the grape imbrowns,</p>
			<p>Than was the passage-way through which ascended<br/>
			Only my Leader and myself behind him,<br/>
			After that company departed from us.</p>
			<p>One climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli,<br/>
			And mounts the summit of Bismantova,<br/>
			With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;</p>
			<p>With the swift pinions and the plumes I say<br/>
			Of great desire, conducted after him<br/>
			Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.</p>
			<p>We mounted upward through the rifted rock,<br/>
			And on each side the border pressed upon us,<br/>
			And feet and hands the ground beneath required.</p>
			<p>When we were come upon the upper rim<br/>
			Of the high bank, out on the open slope,<br/>
			"My Master," said I, "what way shall we take?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "No step of thine descend;<br/>
			Still up the mount behind me win thy way,<br/>
			Till some sage escort shall appear to us."</p>
			<p>The summit was so high it vanquished sight,<br/>
			And the hillside precipitous far more<br/>
			Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.</p>
			<p>Spent with fatigue was I, when I began:<br/>
			"O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold<br/>
			How I remain alone, unless thou stay!"</p>
			<p>"O son," he said, "up yonder drag thyself,"<br/>
			Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,<br/>
			Which on that side encircles all the hill.</p>
			<p>These words of his so spurred me on, that I<br/>
			Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,<br/>
			Until the circle was beneath my feet.</p>
			<p>Thereon ourselves we seated both of us<br/>
			Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,<br/>
			For all men are delighted to look back.</p>
			<p>To the low shores mine eyes I first directed,<br/>
			Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered<br/>
			That on the left hand we were smitten by it.</p>
			<p>The Poet well perceived that I was wholly<br/>
			Bewildered at the chariot of the light,<br/>
			Where 'twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.</p>
			<p>Whereon he said to me: "If Castor and Pollux<br/>
			Were in the company of yonder mirror,<br/>
			That up and down conducteth with its light,</p>
			<p>Thou wouldst behold the zodiac's jagged wheel<br/>
			Revolving still more near unto the Bears,<br/>
			Unless it swerved aside from its old track.</p>
			<p>How that may be wouldst thou have power to think,<br/>
			Collected in thyself, imagine Zion<br/>
			Together with this mount on earth to stand,</p>
			<p>So that they both one sole horizon have,<br/>
			And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road<br/>
			Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,</p>
			<p>Thou'lt see how of necessity must pass<br/>
			This on one side, when that upon the other,<br/>
			If thine intelligence right clearly heed."</p>
			<p>"Truly, my Master," said I, "never yet<br/>
			Saw I so clearly as I now discern,<br/>
			There where my wit appeared incompetent,</p>
			<p>That the mid-circle of supernal motion,<br/>
			Which in some art is the Equator called,<br/>
			And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,</p>
			<p>For reason which thou sayest, departeth hence<br/>
			Tow'rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews<br/>
			Beheld it tow'rds the region of the heat.</p>
			<p>But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn<br/>
			How far we have to go; for the hill rises<br/>
			Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "This mount is such, that ever<br/>
			At the beginning down below 'tis tiresome,<br/>
			And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.</p>
			<p>Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,<br/>
			That going up shall be to thee as easy<br/>
			As going down the current in a boat,</p>
			<p>Then at this pathway's ending thou wilt be;<br/>
			There to repose thy panting breath expect;<br/>
			No more I answer; and this I know for true."</p>
			<p>And as he finished uttering these words,<br/>
			A voice close by us sounded: "Peradventure<br/>
			Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that."</p>
			<p>At sound thereof each one of us turned round,<br/>
			And saw upon the left hand a great rock,<br/>
			Which neither I nor he before had noticed.</p>
			<p>Thither we drew; and there were persons there<br/>
			Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,<br/>
			As one through indolence is wont to stand.</p>
			<p>And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,<br/>
			Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,<br/>
			Holding his face low down between them bowed.</p>
			<p>"O my sweet Lord," I said, "do turn thine eye<br/>
			On him who shows himself more negligent<br/>
			Then even Sloth herself his sister were."</p>
			<p>Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,<br/>
			Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,<br/>
			And said: "Now go thou up, for thou art valiant."</p>
			<p>Then knew I who he was; and the distress,<br/>
			That still a little did my breathing quicken,<br/>
			My going to him hindered not; and after</p>
			<p>I came to him he hardly raised his head,<br/>
			Saying: "Hast thou seen clearly how the sun<br/>
			O'er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?"</p>
			<p>His sluggish attitude and his curt words<br/>
			A little unto laughter moved my lips;<br/>
			Then I began: "Belacqua, I grieve not</p>
			<p>For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated<br/>
			In this place art thou?  Waitest thou an escort?<br/>
			Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?"</p>
			<p>And he: "O brother, what's the use of climbing?<br/>
			Since to my torment would not let me go<br/>
			The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.</p>
			<p>First heaven must needs so long revolve me round<br/>
			Outside thereof, as in my life it did,<br/>
			Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,</p>
			<p>Unless, e'er that, some prayer may bring me aid<br/>
			Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;<br/>
			What profit others that in heaven are heard not?"</p>
			<p>Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,<br/>
			And saying: "Come now; see the sun has touched<br/>
			Meridian, and from the shore the night</p>
			<p>Covers already with her foot Morocco."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto V</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">I had already from those shades departed,<br/>
			And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,<br/>
			When from behind, pointing his finger at me,</p>
			<p>One shouted: "See, it seems as if shone not<br/>
			The sunshine on the left of him below,<br/>
			And like one living seems he to conduct him."</p>
			<p>Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,<br/>
			And saw them watching with astonishment<br/>
			But me, but me, and the light which was broken!</p>
			<p>"Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,"<br/>
			The Master said, "that thou thy pace dost slacken?<br/>
			What matters it to thee what here is whispered?</p>
			<p>Come after me, and let the people talk;<br/>
			Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags<br/>
			Its top for all the blowing of the winds;</p>
			<p>For evermore the man in whom is springing<br/>
			Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,<br/>
			Because the force of one the other weakens."</p>
			<p>What could I say in answer but "I come"?<br/>
			I said it somewhat with that colour tinged<br/>
			Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile along the mountain-side across<br/>
			Came people in advance of us a little,<br/>
			Singing the Miserere verse by verse.</p>
			<p>When they became aware I gave no place<br/>
			For passage of the sunshine through my body,<br/>
			They changed their song into a long, hoarse "Oh!"</p>
			<p>And two of them, in form of messengers,<br/>
			Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,<br/>
			"Of your condition make us cognisant."</p>
			<p>And said my Master: "Ye can go your way<br/>
			And carry back again to those who sent you,<br/>
			That this one's body is of very flesh.</p>
			<p>If they stood still because they saw his shadow,<br/>
			As I suppose, enough is answered them;<br/>
			Him let them honour, it may profit them."</p>
			<p>Vapours enkindled saw I ne'er so swiftly<br/>
			At early nightfall cleave the air serene,<br/>
			Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,</p>
			<p>But upward they returned in briefer time,<br/>
			And, on arriving, with the others wheeled<br/>
			Tow'rds us, like troops that run without a rein.</p>
			<p>"This folk that presses unto us is great,<br/>
			And cometh to implore thee," said the Poet;<br/>
			"So still go onward, and in going listen."</p>
			<p>"O soul that goest to beatitude<br/>
			With the same members wherewith thou wast born,"<br/>
			Shouting they came, "a little stay thy steps,</p>
			<p>Look, if thou e'er hast any of us seen,<br/>
			So that o'er yonder thou bear news of him;<br/>
			Ah, why dost thou go on?  Ah, why not stay?</p>
			<p>Long since we all were slain by violence,<br/>
			And sinners even to the latest hour;<br/>
			Then did a light from heaven admonish us,</p>
			<p>So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth<br/>
			From life we issued reconciled to God,<br/>
			Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts."</p>
			<p>And I: "Although I gaze into your faces,<br/>
			No one I recognize; but if may please you<br/>
			Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,</p>
			<p>Speak ye, and I will do it, by that peace<br/>
			Which, following the feet of such a Guide,<br/>
			From world to world makes itself sought by me."</p>
			<p>And one began: "Each one has confidence<br/>
			In thy good offices without an oath,<br/>
			Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;</p>
			<p>Whence I, who speak alone before the others,<br/>
			Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land<br/>
			That 'twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,</p>
			<p>Thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers<br/>
			In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,<br/>
			That I may purge away my grave offences.</p>
			<p>From thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which<br/>
			Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,<br/>
			Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,</p>
			<p>There where I thought to be the most secure;<br/>
			'Twas he of Este had it done, who held me<br/>
			In hatred far beyond what justice willed.</p>
			<p>But if towards the Mira I had fled,<br/>
			When I was overtaken at Oriaco,<br/>
			I still should be o'er yonder where men breathe.</p>
			<p>I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire<br/>
			Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there<br/>
			A lake made from my veins upon the ground."</p>
			<p>Then said another: "Ah, be that desire<br/>
			Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,<br/>
			As thou with pious pity aidest mine.</p>
			<p>I was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;<br/>
			Giovanna, nor none other cares for me;<br/>
			Hence among these I go with downcast front."</p>
			<p>And I to him: "What violence or what chance<br/>
			Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,<br/>
			That never has thy sepulture been known?"</p>
			<p>"Oh," he replied, "at Casentino's foot<br/>
			A river crosses named Archiano, born<br/>
			Above the Hermitage in Apennine.</p>
			<p>There where the name thereof becometh void<br/>
			Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,<br/>
			Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;</p>
			<p>There my sight lost I, and my utterance<br/>
			Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat<br/>
			I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained.</p>
			<p>Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;<br/>
			God's Angel took me up, and he of hell<br/>
			Shouted: 'O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?</p>
			<p>Thou bearest away the eternal part of him,<br/>
			For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;<br/>
			But with the rest I'll deal in other fashion!'</p>
			<p>Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered<br/>
			That humid vapour which to water turns,<br/>
			Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.</p>
			<p>He joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil,<br/>
			To intellect, and moved the mist and wind<br/>
			By means of power, which his own nature gave;</p>
			<p>Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley<br/>
			From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered<br/>
			With fog, and made the heaven above intent,</p>
			<p>So that the pregnant air to water changed;<br/>
			Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came<br/>
			Whate'er of it earth tolerated not;</p>
			<p>And as it mingled with the mighty torrents,<br/>
			Towards the royal river with such speed<br/>
			It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back.</p>
			<p>My frozen body near unto its outlet<br/>
			The robust Archian found, and into Arno<br/>
			Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross</p>
			<p>I made of me, when agony o'ercame me;<br/>
			It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom,<br/>
			Then with its booty covered and begirt me."</p>
			<p>"Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world,<br/>
			And rested thee from thy long journeying,"<br/>
			After the second followed the third spirit,</p>
			<p>"Do thou remember me who am the Pia;<br/>
			Siena made me, unmade me Maremma;<br/>

			<p>Rose tow'rds him from the place where first it was,<br/>
			Saying: "O Mantuan, I am Sordello<br/>

			<p>Ah! servile Italy, grief's hostelry!<br/>
			A ship without a pilot in great tempest!<br/>
			No Lady thou of Provinces, but brothel!</p>
			<p>That noble soul was so impatient, only<br/>
			At the sweet sound of his own native land,<br/>
			To make its citizen glad welcome there;</p>
			<p>And now within thee are not without war<br/>

			<p>Ah! people, thou that oughtest to be devout,<br/>
			And to let Caesar sit upon the saddle,<br/>
			If well thou hearest what God teacheth thee,</p>

			Since thou hast laid thy hand upon the bridle.</p>
			<p>O German Albert! who abandonest<br/>

			And oughtest to bestride her saddle-bow,</p>
			<p>May a just judgment from the stars down fall<br/>
			Upon thy blood, and be it new and open,<br/>
			That thy successor may have fear thereof;</p>
			<p>Because thy father and thyself have suffered,<br/>

			But on their very lips thy people have it!</p>
			<p>Many refuse to bear the common burden;<br/>
			But thy solicitous people answereth<br/>
			Without being asked, and crieth: "I submit."</p>
			<p>Now be thou joyful, for thou hast good reason;<br/>

			<p>Athens and Lacedaemon, they who made<br/>
			The ancient laws, and were so civilized,<br/>
			Made towards living well a little sign</p>
			<p>Compared with thee, who makest such fine-spun<br/>
			Provisions, that to middle of November<br/>
			Reaches not what thou in October spinnest.</p>
			<p>How oft, within the time of thy remembrance,<br/>
			Laws, money, offices, and usages<br/>
			Hast thou remodelled, and renewed thy members?</p>
			<p>And if thou mind thee well, and see the light,<br/>

			<p>There dwell I among those who the three saintly<br/>

			Therefore 'tis well to think of some fair sojourn.</p>
			<p>Souls are there on the right hand here withdrawn;<br/>
			If thou permit me I will lead thee to them,<br/>
			And thou shalt know them not without delight."</p>
			<p>"How is this?" was the answer; "should one wish<br/>
			To mount by night would he prevented be<br/>
			By others? or mayhap would not have power?"</p>
			<p>And on the ground the good Sordello drew<br/>
			His finger, saying, "See, this line alone<br/>
			Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone;</p>
			<p>Not that aught else would hindrance give, however,<br/>
			To going up, save the nocturnal darkness;<br/>

			<p>Thereon my Lord, as if in wonder, said:<br/>
			"Do thou conduct us thither, where thou sayest<br/>
			That we can take delight in tarrying."</p>
			<p>Little had we withdrawn us from that place,<br/>
			When I perceived the mount was hollowed out<br/>
			In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed.</p>
			<p>"Thitherward," said that shade, "will we repair,<br/>
			Where of itself the hill-side makes a lap,<br/>
			And there for the new day will we await."</p>

			Uprisen, that begged attention with its hand.</p>
			<p>It joined and lifted upward both its palms,<br/>
			Fixing its eyes upon the orient,<br/>
			As if it said to God, "Naught else I care for."</p>
			<p>"Te lucis ante" so devoutly issued<br/>
			Forth from its mouth, and with such dulcet notes,<br/>
			It made me issue forth from my own mind.</p>
			<p>And then the others, sweetly and devoutly,<br/>
			Accompanied it through all the hymn entire,<br/>
			Having their eyes on the supernal wheels.</p>
			<p>Here, Reader, fix thine eyes well on the truth,<br/>
			For now indeed so subtile is the veil,<br/>
			Surely to penetrate within is easy.</p>
			<p>I saw that army of the gentle-born<br/>
			Thereafterward in silence upward gaze,<br/>
			As if in expectation, pale and humble;</p>
			<p>And from on high come forth and down descend,<br/>
			I saw two Angels with two flaming swords,<br/>
			Truncated and deprived of their points.</p>
			<p>Green as the little leaflets just now born<br/>
			Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions<br/>
			Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.</p>
			<p>One just above us came to take his station,<br/>
			And one descended to the opposite bank,<br/>
			So that the people were contained between them.</p>
			<p>Clearly in them discerned I the blond head;<br/>
			But in their faces was the eye bewildered,<br/>
			As faculty confounded by excess.</p>
			<p>"From Mary's bosom both of them have come,"<br/>
			Sordello said, "as guardians of the valley<br/>
			Against the serpent, that will come anon."</p>
			<p>Whereupon I, who knew not by what road,<br/>
			Turned round about, and closely drew myself,<br/>
			Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders.</p>
			<p>And once again Sordello: "Now descend we<br/>
			'Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them;<br/>
			Right pleasant will it be for them to see you."</p>
			<p>Only three steps I think that I descended,<br/>
			And was below, and saw one who was looking<br/>
			Only at me, as if he fain would know me.</p>
			<p>Already now the air was growing dark,<br/>
			But not so that between his eyes and mine<br/>
			It did not show what it before locked up.</p>
			<p>Tow'rds me he moved, and I tow'rds him did move;<br/>
			Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,<br/>
			When I beheld thee not among the damned!</p>
			<p>No greeting fair was left unsaid between us;<br/>
			Then asked he: "How long is it since thou camest<br/>
			O'er the far waters to the mountain's foot?"</p>
			<p>"Oh!" said I to him, "through the dismal places<br/>
			I came this morn; and am in the first life,<br/>
			Albeit the other, going thus, I gain."</p>
			<p>And on the instant my reply was heard,<br/>
			He and Sordello both shrank back from me,<br/>
			Like people who are suddenly bewildered.</p>
			<p>One to Virgilius, and the other turned<br/>
			To one who sat there, crying, "Up, Currado!<br/>
			Come and behold what God in grace has willed!"</p>
			<p>Then, turned to me: "By that especial grace<br/>
			Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals<br/>
			His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,</p>
			<p>When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,<br/>
			Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,<br/>
			Where answer to the innocent is made.</p>
			<p>I do not think her mother loves me more,<br/>
			Since she has laid aside her wimple white,<br/>
			Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.</p>
			<p>Through her full easily is comprehended<br/>
			How long in woman lasts the fire of love,<br/>
			If eye or touch do not relight it often.</p>
			<p>So fair a hatchment will not make for her<br/>
			The Viper marshalling the Milanese<br/>
			A-field, as would have made Gallura's Cock."</p>
			<p>In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed<br/>
			Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal<br/>
			Which measurably burneth in the heart.</p>
			<p>My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,<br/>
			Still to that point where slowest are the stars,<br/>
			Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.</p>
			<p>And my Conductor: "Son, what dost thou gaze at<br/>
			Up there?"  And I to him: "At those three torches<br/>
			With which this hither pole is all on fire."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "The four resplendent stars<br/>
			Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,<br/>
			And these have mounted up to where those were."</p>
			<p>As he was speaking, to himself Sordello<br/>
			Drew him, and said, "Lo there our Adversary!"<br/>
			And pointed with his finger to look thither.</p>
			<p>Upon the side on which the little valley<br/>
			No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance<br/>
			The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.</p>
			<p>'Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,<br/>
			Turning at times its head about, and licking<br/>
			Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.</p>
			<p>I did not see, and therefore cannot say<br/>
			How the celestial falcons 'gan to move,<br/>
			But well I saw that they were both in motion.</p>
			<p>Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,<br/>
			The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,<br/>
			Up to their stations flying back alike.</p>
			<p>The shade that to the Judge had near approached<br/>
			When he had called, throughout that whole assault<br/>
			Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.</p>
			<p>"So may the light that leadeth thee on high<br/>
			Find in thine own free-will as much of wax<br/>
			As needful is up to the highest azure,"</p>
			<p>Began it, "if some true intelligence<br/>
			Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood<br/>
			Thou knowest, tell it me, who once was great there.</p>
			<p>Currado Malaspina was I called;<br/>
			I'm not the elder, but from him descended;<br/>
			To mine I bore the love which here refineth."</p>
			<p>"O," said I unto him, "through your domains<br/>
			I never passed, but where is there a dwelling<br/>
			Throughout all Europe, where they are not known?</p>
			<p>That fame, which doeth honour to your house,<br/>
			Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land,<br/>
			So that he knows of them who ne'er was there.</p>
			<p>And, as I hope for heaven, I swear to you<br/>
			Your honoured family in naught abates<br/>
			The glory of the purse and of the sword.</p>
			<p>It is so privileged by use and nature,<br/>
			That though a guilty head misguide the world,<br/>
			Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way."</p>
			<p>And he: "Now go; for the sun shall not lie<br/>
			Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram<br/>
			With all his four feet covers and bestrides,</p>
			<p>Before that such a courteous opinion<br/>
			Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed<br/>
			With greater nails than of another's speech,</p>
			<p>Unless the course of justice standeth still."</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 2em">The concubine of old Tithonus now<br/>
			Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,<br/>
			Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour;</p>
			<p>With gems her forehead all relucent was,<br/>
			Set in the shape of that cold animal<br/>
			Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations,</p>
			<p>And of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night<br/>
			Had taken two in that place where we were,<br/>
			And now the third was bending down its wings;</p>
			<p>When I, who something had of Adam in me,<br/>
			Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,<br/>
			There were all five of us already sat.</p>
			<p>Just at the hour when her sad lay begins<br/>
			The little swallow, near unto the morning,<br/>
			Perchance in memory of her former woes,</p>
			<p>And when the mind of man, a wanderer<br/>
			More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,<br/>
			Almost prophetic in its visions is,</p>
			<p>In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended<br/>
			An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,<br/>
			With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,</p>
			<p>And this, it seemed to me, was where had been<br/>
			By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,<br/>
			When to the high consistory he was rapt.</p>
			<p>I thought within myself, perchance he strikes<br/>
			From habit only here, and from elsewhere<br/>
			Disdains to bear up any in his feet.</p>
			<p>Then wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,<br/>
			Terrible as the lightning he descended,<br/>
			And snatched me upward even to the fire.</p>
			<p>Therein it seemed that he and I were burning,<br/>
			And the imagined fire did scorch me so,<br/>
			That of necessity my sleep was broken.</p>
			<p>Not otherwise Achilles started up,<br/>
			Around him turning his awakened eyes,<br/>
			And knowing not the place in which he was,</p>
			<p>What time from Chiron stealthily his mother<br/>
			Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros,<br/>
			Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,</p>
			<p>Than I upstarted, when from off my face<br/>
			Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,<br/>
			As doth the man who freezes with affright.</p>
			<p>Only my Comforter was at my side,<br/>
			And now the sun was more than two hours high,<br/>
			And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.</p>
			<p>"Be not intimidated," said my Lord,<br/>
			"Be reassured, for all is well with us;<br/>
			Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.</p>
			<p>Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;<br/>
			See there the cliff that closes it around;<br/>
			See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.</p>
			<p>Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,<br/>
			When inwardly thy spirit was asleep<br/>
			Upon the flowers that deck the land below,</p>
			<p>There came a Lady and said: 'I am Lucia;<br/>
			Let me take this one up, who is asleep;<br/>
			So will I make his journey easier for him.'</p>
			<p>Sordello and the other noble shapes<br/>
			Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,<br/>
			Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.</p>
			<p>She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes<br/>
			That open entrance pointed out to me;<br/>
			Then she and sleep together went away."</p>
			<p>In guise of one whose doubts are reassured,<br/>
			And who to confidence his fear doth change,<br/>
			After the truth has been discovered to him,</p>
			<p>So did I change; and when without disquiet<br/>
			My Leader saw me, up along the cliff<br/>
			He moved, and I behind him, tow'rd the height.</p>
			<p>Reader, thou seest well how I exalt<br/>
			My theme, and therefore if with greater art<br/>
			I fortify it, marvel not thereat.</p>
			<p>Nearer approached we, and were in such place,<br/>
			That there, where first appeared to me a rift<br/>
			Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,</p>
			<p>I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,<br/>
			Diverse in colour, to go up to it,<br/>
			And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.</p>
			<p>And as I opened more and more mine eyes,<br/>
			I saw him seated on the highest stair,<br/>
			Such in the face that I endured it not.</p>
			<p>And in his hand he had a naked sword,<br/>
			Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow'rds us,<br/>
			That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.</p>
			<p>"Tell it from where you are, what is't you wish?"<br/>
			Began he to exclaim; "where is the escort?<br/>
			Take heed your coming hither harm you not!"</p>
			<p>"A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,"<br/>
			My Master answered him, "but even now<br/>
			Said to us, 'Thither go; there is the portal.'"</p>
			<p>"And may she speed your footsteps in all good,"<br/>
			Again began the courteous janitor;<br/>
			"Come forward then unto these stairs of ours."</p>
			<p>Thither did we approach; and the first stair<br/>
			Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,<br/>
			I mirrored myself therein as I appear.</p>
			<p>The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,<br/>
			Was of a calcined and uneven stone,<br/>
			Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.</p>
			<p>The third, that uppermost rests massively,<br/>
			Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red<br/>
			As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.</p>
			<p>Both of his feet was holding upon this<br/>
			The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,<br/>
			Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.</p>
			<p>Along the three stairs upward with good will<br/>
			Did my Conductor draw me, saying: "Ask<br/>
			Humbly that he the fastening may undo."</p>
			<p>Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,<br/>
			For mercy's sake besought that he would open,<br/>
			But first upon my breast three times I smote.</p>
			<p>Seven P's upon my forehead he described<br/>
			With the sword's point, and, "Take heed that thou wash<br/>
			These wounds, when thou shalt be within," he said.</p>
			<p>Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,<br/>
			Of the same colour were with his attire,<br/>
			And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.</p>
			<p>One was of gold, and the other was of silver;<br/>
			First with the white, and after with the yellow,<br/>
			Plied he the door, so that I was content.</p>
			<p>"Whenever faileth either of these keys<br/>
			So that it turn not rightly in the lock,"<br/>
			He said to us, "this entrance doth not open.</p>
			<p>More precious one is, but the other needs<br/>
			More art and intellect ere it unlock,<br/>
			For it is that which doth the knot unloose.</p>
			<p>From Peter I have them; and he bade me err<br/>
			Rather in opening than in keeping shut,<br/>
			If people but fall down before my feet."</p>
			<p>Then pushed the portals of the sacred door,<br/>
			Exclaiming: "Enter; but I give you warning<br/>
			That forth returns whoever looks behind."</p>
			<p>And when upon their hinges were turned round<br/>
			The swivels of that consecrated gate,<br/>
			Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,</p>
			<p>Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed<br/>
			Tarpeia, when was ta'en from it the good<br/>
			Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.</p>
			<p>At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,<br/>
			And "Te Deum laudamus" seemed to hear<br/>
			In voices mingled with sweet melody.</p>
			<p>Exactly such an image rendered me<br/>
			That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,<br/>
			When people singing with the organ stand;</p>
			<p>For now we hear, and now hear not, the words.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto X</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">When we had crossed the threshold of the door<br/>
			Which the perverted love of souls disuses,<br/>
			Because it makes the crooked way seem straight,</p>
			<p>Re-echoing I heard it closed again;<br/>
			And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,<br/>
			What for my failing had been fit excuse?</p>
			<p>We mounted upward through a rifted rock,<br/>
			Which undulated to this side and that,<br/>
			Even as a wave receding and advancing.</p>
			<p>"Here it behoves us use a little art,"<br/>
			Began my Leader, "to adapt ourselves<br/>

			<p>And this our footsteps so infrequent made,<br/>

			Regained its bed to sink again to rest,</p>
			<p>Than we were forth from out that needle's eye;<br/>
			But when we free and in the open were,<br/>
			There where the mountain backward piles itself,</p>
			<p>I wearied out, and both of us uncertain<br/>
			About our way, we stopped upon a plain<br/>
			More desolate than roads across the deserts.</p>
			<p>From where its margin borders on the void,<br/>
			To foot of the high bank that ever rises,<br/>
			A human body three times told would measure;</p>
			<p>And far as eye of mine could wing its flight,<br/>

			<p>Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet,<br/>
			When I perceived the embankment round about,<br/>
			Which all right of ascent had interdicted,</p>
			<p>To be of marble white, and so adorned<br/>
			With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,<br/>
			But Nature's self, had there been put to shame.</p>
			<p>The Angel, who came down to earth with tidings<br/>
			Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,<br/>
			And opened Heaven from its long interdict,</p>
			<p>In front of us appeared so truthfully<br/>
			There sculptured in a gracious attitude,<br/>
			He did not seem an image that is silent.</p>
			<p>One would have sworn that he was saying, "Ave;"<br/>
			For she was there in effigy portrayed<br/>
			Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,</p>
			<p>And in her mien this language had impressed,<br/>
			"Ecce ancilla Dei," as distinctly<br/>
			As any figure stamps itself in wax.</p>
			<p>"Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,"<br/>
			The gentle Master said, who had me standing<br/>
			Upon that side where people have their hearts;</p>
			<p>Whereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld<br/>
			In rear of Mary, and upon that side<br/>
			Where he was standing who conducted me,</p>
			<p>Another story on the rock imposed;<br/>
			Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,<br/>
			So that before mine eyes it might be set.</p>
			<p>There sculptured in the self-same marble were<br/>
			The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,<br/>
			Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.</p>
			<p>People appeared in front, and all of them<br/>
			In seven choirs divided, of two senses<br/>
			Made one say "No," the other, "Yes, they sing."</p>
			<p>Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,<br/>
			Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose<br/>
			Were in the yes and no discordant made.</p>
			<p>Preceded there the vessel benedight,<br/>
			Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,<br/>
			And more and less than King was he in this.</p>
			<p>Opposite, represented at the window<br/>
			Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,<br/>
			Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.</p>
			<p>I moved my feet from where I had been standing,<br/>
			To examine near at hand another story,<br/>
			Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.</p>
			<p>There the high glory of the Roman Prince<br/>
			Was chronicled, whose great beneficence<br/>
			Moved Gregory to his great victory;</p>
			<p>'Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;<br/>
			And a poor widow at his bridle stood,<br/>
			In attitude of weeping and of grief.</p>
			<p>Around about him seemed it thronged and full<br/>
			Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold<br/>
			Above them visibly in the wind were moving.</p>
			<p>The wretched woman in the midst of these<br/>
			Seemed to be saying: "Give me vengeance, Lord,<br/>
			For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking."</p>
			<p>And he to answer her: "Now wait until<br/>
			I shall return."  And she: "My Lord," like one<br/>
			In whom grief is impatient, "shouldst thou not</p>
			<p>Return?"  And he: "Who shall be where I am<br/>
			Will give it thee."  And she: "Good deed of others<br/>
			What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?"</p>
			<p>Whence he: "Now comfort thee, for it behoves me<br/>
			That I discharge my duty ere I move;<br/>
			Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me."</p>
			<p>He who on no new thing has ever looked<br/>
			Was the creator of this visible language,<br/>
			Novel to us, for here it is not found.</p>
			<p>While I delighted me in contemplating<br/>
			The images of such humility,<br/>
			And dear to look on for their Maker's sake,</p>
			<p>"Behold, upon this side, but rare they make<br/>
			Their steps," the Poet murmured, "many people;<br/>
			These will direct us to the lofty stairs."</p>
			<p>Mine eyes, that in beholding were intent<br/>
			To see new things, of which they curious are,<br/>
			In turning round towards him were not slow.</p>
			<p>But still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve<br/>
			From thy good purposes, because thou hearest<br/>
			How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;</p>
			<p>Attend not to the fashion of the torment,<br/>
			Think of what follows; think that at the worst<br/>
			It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence.</p>
			<p>"Master," began I, "that which I behold<br/>
			Moving towards us seems to me not persons,<br/>
			And what I know not, so in sight I waver."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "The grievous quality<br/>
			Of this their torment bows them so to earth,<br/>

			<p>But look there fixedly, and disentangle<br/>
			By sight what cometh underneath those stones;<br/>
			Already canst thou see how each is stricken."</p>
			<p>O ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones!<br/>
			Who, in the vision of the mind infirm<br/>
			Confidence have in your backsliding steps,</p>

			<p>Which makes of the unreal real anguish<br/>
			Arise in him who sees it, fashioned thus<br/>
			Beheld I those, when I had ta'en good heed.</p>
			<p>True is it, they were more or less bent down,<br/>

			<p>In sooth I had not been so courteous<br/>
			While I was living, for the great desire<br/>
			Of excellence, on which my heart was bent.</p>
			<p>Here of such pride is paid the forfeiture;<br/>
			And yet I should not be here, were it not<br/>
			That, having power to sin, I turned to God.</p>
			<p>O thou vain glory of the human powers,<br/>
			How little green upon thy summit lingers,<br/>
			If't be not followed by an age of grossness!</p>
			<p>In painting Cimabue thought that he<br/>
			Should hold the field, now Giotto has the cry,<br/>
			So that the other's fame is growing dim.</p>
			<p>So has one Guido from the other taken<br/>
			The glory of our tongue, and he perchance<br/>
			Is born, who from the nest shall chase them both.</p>
			<p>Naught is this mundane rumour but a breath<br/>
			Of wind, that comes now this way and now that,<br/>
			And changes name, because it changes side.</p>
			<p>What fame shalt thou have more, if old peel off<br/>
			From thee thy flesh, than if thou hadst been dead<br/>
			Before thou left the 'pappo' and the 'dindi,'</p>
			<p>Ere pass a thousand years? which is a shorter<br/>
			Space to the eterne, than twinkling of an eye<br/>
			Unto the circle that in heaven wheels slowest.</p>
			<p>With him, who takes so little of the road<br/>
			In front of me, all Tuscany resounded;<br/>
			And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,</p>
			<p>Where he was lord, what time was overthrown<br/>
			The Florentine delirium, that superb<br/>
			Was at that day as now 'tis prostitute.</p>
			<p>Your reputation is the colour of grass<br/>
			Which comes and goes, and that discolours it<br/>
			By which it issues green from out the earth."</p>
			<p>And I: "Thy true speech fills my heart with good<br/>
			Humility, and great tumour thou assuagest;<br/>
			But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?"</p>
			<p>"That," he replied, "is Provenzan Salvani,<br/>
			And he is here because he had presumed<br/>
			To bring Siena all into his hands.</p>
			<p>He has gone thus, and goeth without rest<br/>
			E'er since he died; such money renders back<br/>
			In payment he who is on earth too daring."</p>
			<p>And I: "If every spirit who awaits<br/>
			The verge of life before that he repent,<br/>
			Remains below there and ascends not hither,</p>
			<p>(Unless good orison shall him bestead,)<br/>
			Until as much time as he lived be passed,<br/>
			How was the coming granted him in largess?"</p>
			<p>"When he in greatest splendour lived," said he,<br/>
			"Freely upon the Campo of Siena,<br/>
			All shame being laid aside, he placed himself;</p>
			<p>And there to draw his friend from the duress<br/>
			Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered,<br/>
			He brought himself to tremble in each vein.</p>
			<p>I say no more, and know that I speak darkly;<br/>
			Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbours<br/>
			Will so demean themselves that thou canst gloss it.</p>
			<p>This action has released him from those confines."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Abreast, like oxen going in a yoke,<br/>
			I with that heavy-laden soul went on,<br/>
			As long as the sweet pedagogue permitted;</p>
			<p>But when he said, "Leave him, and onward pass,<br/>
			For here 'tis good that with the sail and oars,<br/>
			As much as may be, each push on his barque;"</p>
			<p>Upright, as walking wills it, I redressed<br/>
			My person, notwithstanding that my thoughts<br/>
			Remained within me downcast and abashed.</p>
			<p>I had moved on, and followed willingly<br/>
			The footsteps of my Master, and we both<br/>
			Already showed how light of foot we were,</p>
			<p>When unto me he said: "Cast down thine eyes;<br/>
			'Twere well for thee, to alleviate the way,<br/>
			To look upon the bed beneath thy feet."</p>
			<p>As, that some memory may exist of them,<br/>
			Above the buried dead their tombs in earth<br/>
			Bear sculptured on them what they were before;</p>
			<p>Whence often there we weep for them afresh,<br/>
			From pricking of remembrance, which alone<br/>
			To the compassionate doth set its spur;</p>
			<p>So saw I there, but of a better semblance<br/>
			In point of artifice, with figures covered<br/>
			Whate'er as pathway from the mount projects.</p>
			<p>I saw that one who was created noble<br/>
			More than all other creatures, down from heaven<br/>
			Flaming with lightnings fall upon one side.</p>
			<p>I saw Briareus smitten by the dart<br/>
			Celestial, lying on the other side,<br/>
			Heavy upon the earth by mortal frost.</p>
			<p>I saw Thymbraeus, Pallas saw, and Mars,<br/>
			Still clad in armour round about their father,<br/>
			Gaze at the scattered members of the giants.</p>
			<p>I saw, at foot of his great labour, Nimrod,<br/>
			As if bewildered, looking at the people<br/>
			Who had been proud with him in Sennaar.</p>
			<p>O Niobe! with what afflicted eyes<br/>
			Thee I beheld upon the pathway traced,<br/>
			Between thy seven and seven children slain!</p>
			<p>O Saul! how fallen upon thy proper sword<br/>
			Didst thou appear there lifeless in Gilboa,<br/>
			That felt thereafter neither rain nor dew!</p>
			<p>O mad Arachne! so I thee beheld<br/>
			E'en then half spider, sad upon the shreds<br/>
			Of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee!</p>
			<p>O Rehoboam! no more seems to threaten<br/>
			Thine image there; but full of consternation<br/>
			A chariot bears it off, when none pursues!</p>
			<p>Displayed moreo'er the adamantine pavement<br/>
			How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon<br/>
			Costly appear the luckless ornament;</p>
			<p>Displayed how his own sons did throw themselves<br/>
			Upon Sennacherib within the temple,<br/>
			And how, he being dead, they left him there;</p>
			<p>Displayed the ruin and the cruel carnage<br/>
			That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said,<br/>
			"Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!"</p>
			<p>Displayed how routed fled the Assyrians<br/>
			After that Holofernes had been slain,<br/>
			And likewise the remainder of that slaughter.</p>
			<p>I saw there Troy in ashes and in caverns;<br/>
			O Ilion! thee, how abject and debased,<br/>
			Displayed the image that is there discerned!</p>
			<p>Whoe'er of pencil master was or stile,<br/>
			That could portray the shades and traits which there<br/>
			Would cause each subtile genius to admire?</p>
			<p>Dead seemed the dead, the living seemed alive;<br/>
			Better than I saw not who saw the truth,<br/>
			All that I trod upon while bowed I went.</p>
			<p>Now wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted,<br/>
			Ye sons of Eve, and bow not down your faces<br/>
			So that ye may behold your evil ways!</p>
			<p>More of the mount by us was now encompassed,<br/>
			And far more spent the circuit of the sun,<br/>
			Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,</p>
			<p>When he, who ever watchful in advance<br/>
			Was going on, began: "Lift up thy head,<br/>
			'Tis no more time to go thus meditating.</p>
			<p>Lo there an Angel who is making haste<br/>
			To come towards us; lo, returning is<br/>
			From service of the day the sixth handmaiden.</p>
			<p>With reverence thine acts and looks adorn,<br/>
			So that he may delight to speed us upward;<br/>
			Think that this day will never dawn again."</p>
			<p>I was familiar with his admonition<br/>
			Ever to lose no time; so on this theme<br/>
			He could not unto me speak covertly.</p>
			<p>Towards us came the being beautiful<br/>
			Vested in white, and in his countenance<br/>
			Such as appears the tremulous morning star.</p>
			<p>His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;<br/>
			"Come," said he, "near at hand here are the steps,<br/>
			And easy from henceforth is the ascent."</p>
			<p>At this announcement few are they who come!<br/>
			O human creatures, born to soar aloft,<br/>
			Why fall ye thus before a little wind?</p>
			<p>He led us on to where the rock was cleft;<br/>
			There smote upon my forehead with his wings,<br/>
			Then a safe passage promised unto me.</p>
			<p>As on the right hand, to ascend the mount<br/>
			Where seated is the church that lordeth it<br/>
			O'er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,</p>
			<p>The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken<br/>
			By stairways that were made there in the age<br/>
			When still were safe the ledger and the stave,</p>
			<p>E'en thus attempered is the bank which falls<br/>
			Sheer downward from the second circle there;<br/>
			But on this, side and that the high rock graze.</p>
			<p>As we were turning thitherward our persons,<br/>
			"Beati pauperes spiritu," voices<br/>
			Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.</p>
			<p>Ah me! how different are these entrances<br/>
			From the Infernal! for with anthems here<br/>
			One enters, and below with wild laments.</p>
			<p>We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,<br/>
			And it appeared to me by far more easy<br/>
			Than on the plain it had appeared before.</p>
			<p>Whence I: "My Master, say, what heavy thing<br/>
			Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly<br/>
			Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?"</p>
			<p>He answered: "When the P's which have remained<br/>
			Still on thy face almost obliterate<br/>
			Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,</p>
			<p>Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,<br/>
			That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,<br/>
			But urging up will be to them delight."</p>
			<p>Then did I even as they do who are going<br/>
			With something on the head to them unknown,<br/>
			Unless the signs of others make them doubt,</p>
			<p>Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,<br/>
			And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office<br/>
			Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;</p>
			<p>And with the fingers of the right hand spread<br/>
			I found but six the letters, that had carved<br/>
			Upon my temples he who bore the keys;</p>
			<p>Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">We were upon the summit of the stairs,<br/>
			Where for the second time is cut away<br/>
			The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.</p>
			<p>There in like manner doth a cornice bind<br/>
			The hill all round about, as does the first,<br/>
			Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.</p>
			<p>Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;<br/>
			So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,<br/>
			With but the livid colour of the stone.</p>
			<p>"If to inquire we wait for people here,"<br/>
			The Poet said, "I fear that peradventure<br/>
			Too much delay will our election have."</p>
			<p>Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,<br/>
			Made his right side the centre of his motion,<br/>
			And turned the left part of himself about.</p>
			<p>"O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter<br/>
			Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,"<br/>
			Said he, "as one within here should be led.</p>
			<p>Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;<br/>
			If other reason prompt not otherwise,<br/>
			Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!"</p>
			<p>As much as here is counted for a mile,<br/>
			So much already there had we advanced<br/>
			In little time, by dint of ready will;</p>
			<p>And tow'rds us there were heard to fly, albeit<br/>
			They were not visible, spirits uttering<br/>
			Unto Love's table courteous invitations,</p>
			<p>The first voice that passed onward in its flight,<br/>
			"Vinum non habent," said in accents loud,<br/>
			And went reiterating it behind us.</p>
			<p>And ere it wholly grew inaudible<br/>
			Because of distance, passed another, crying,<br/>
			"I am Orestes!" and it also stayed not.</p>
			<p>"O," said I, "Father, these, what voices are they?"<br/>
			And even as I asked, behold the third,<br/>
			Saying: "Love those from whom ye have had evil!"</p>
			<p>And the good Master said: "This circle scourges<br/>
			The sin of envy, and on that account<br/>
			Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.</p>
			<p>The bridle of another sound shall be;<br/>
			I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,<br/>
			Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.</p>
			<p>But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,<br/>
			And people thou wilt see before us sitting,<br/>
			And each one close against the cliff is seated."</p>
			<p>Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;<br/>
			I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles<br/>
			Not from the colour of the stone diverse.</p>
			<p>And when we were a little farther onward,<br/>
			I heard a cry of, "Mary, pray for us!"<br/>
			A cry of, "Michael, Peter, and all Saints!"</p>
			<p>I do not think there walketh still on earth<br/>
			A man so hard, that he would not be pierced<br/>
			With pity at what afterward I saw.</p>
			<p>For when I had approached so near to them<br/>
			That manifest to me their acts became,<br/>
			Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.</p>
			<p>Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,<br/>
			And one sustained the other with his shoulder,<br/>
			And all of them were by the bank sustained.</p>
			<p>Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,<br/>
			Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,<br/>
			And one upon another leans his head,</p>
			<p>So that in others pity soon may rise,<br/>
			Not only at the accent of their words,<br/>
			But at their aspect, which no less implores.</p>
			<p>And as unto the blind the sun comes not,<br/>
			So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,<br/>
			Heaven's light will not be bounteous of itself;</p>
			<p>For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,<br/>
			And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild<br/>
			Is done, because it will not quiet stay.</p>
			<p>To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,<br/>
			Seeing the others without being seen;<br/>
			Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.</p>
			<p>Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,<br/>
			And therefore waited not for my demand,<br/>
			But said: "Speak, and be brief, and to the point."</p>
			<p>I had Virgilius upon that side<br/>
			Of the embankment from which one may fall,<br/>
			Since by no border 'tis engarlanded;</p>
			<p>Upon the other side of me I had<br/>
			The shades devout, who through the horrible seam<br/>
			Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.</p>
			<p>To them I turned me, and, "O people, certain,"<br/>
			Began I, "of beholding the high light,<br/>
			Which your desire has solely in its care,</p>
			<p>So may grace speedily dissolve the scum<br/>
			Upon your consciences, that limpidly<br/>
			Through them descend the river of the mind,</p>
			<p>Tell me, for dear 'twill be to me and gracious,<br/>
			If any soul among you here is Latian,<br/>
			And 'twill perchance be good for him I learn it."</p>
			<p>"O brother mine, each one is citizen<br/>
			Of one true city; but thy meaning is,<br/>
			Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim."</p>
			<p>By way of answer this I seemed to hear<br/>
			A little farther on than where I stood,<br/>
			Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.</p>
			<p>Among the rest I saw a shade that waited<br/>
			In aspect, and should any one ask how,<br/>
			Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.</p>
			<p>"Spirit," I said, "who stoopest to ascend,<br/>
			If thou art he who did reply to me,<br/>
			Make thyself known to me by place or name."</p>
			<p>"Sienese was I," it replied, "and with<br/>
			The others here recleanse my guilty life,<br/>
			Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.</p>
			<p>Sapient I was not, although I Sapia<br/>
			Was called, and I was at another's harm<br/>
			More happy far than at my own good fortune.</p>
			<p>And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,<br/>
			Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.<br/>
			The arc already of my years descending,</p>
			<p>My fellow-citizens near unto Colle<br/>
			Were joined in battle with their adversaries,<br/>
			And I was praying God for what he willed.</p>
			<p>Routed were they, and turned into the bitter<br/>
			Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,<br/>
			A joy received unequalled by all others;</p>
			<p>So that I lifted upward my bold face<br/>
			Crying to God, 'Henceforth I fear thee not,'<br/>
			As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.</p>
			<p>Peace I desired with God at the extreme<br/>
			Of my existence, and as yet would not<br/>
			My debt have been by penitence discharged,</p>
			<p>Had it not been that in remembrance held me<br/>
			Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,<br/>
			Who out of charity was grieved for me.</p>
			<p>But who art thou, that into our conditions<br/>
			Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound<br/>
			As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?"</p>
			<p>"Mine eyes," I said, "will yet be here ta'en from me,<br/>
			But for short space; for small is the offence<br/>
			Committed by their being turned with envy.</p>
			<p>Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended<br/>
			My soul is, of the torment underneath,<br/>
			For even now the load down there weighs on me."</p>
			<p>And she to me: "Who led thee, then, among us<br/>
			Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?"<br/>
			And I: "He who is with me, and speaks not;</p>
			<p>And living am I; therefore ask of me,<br/>
			Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move<br/>
			O'er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee."</p>
			<p>"O, this is such a novel thing to hear,"<br/>
			She answered, "that great sign it is God loves thee;<br/>
			Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.</p>
			<p>And I implore, by what thou most desirest,<br/>
			If e'er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,<br/>
			Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.</p>
			<p>Them wilt thou see among that people vain<br/>
			Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there<br/>
			More hope than in discovering the Diana;</p>
			<p>But there still more the admirals will lose."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XIV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">"Who is this one that goes about our mountain,<br/>
			Or ever Death has given him power of flight,<br/>
			And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?"</p>
			<p>"I know not who, but know he's not alone;<br/>
			Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,<br/>
			And gently, so that he may speak, accost him."</p>
			<p>Thus did two spirits, leaning tow'rds each other,<br/>
			Discourse about me there on the right hand;<br/>
			Then held supine their faces to address me.</p>
			<p>And said the one: "O soul, that, fastened still<br/>
			Within the body, tow'rds the heaven art going,<br/>
			For charity console us, and declare</p>
			<p>Whence comest and who art thou; for thou mak'st us<br/>
			As much to marvel at this grace of thine<br/>
			As must a thing that never yet has been."</p>
			<p>And I: "Through midst of Tuscany there wanders<br/>
			A streamlet that is born in Falterona,<br/>
			And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;</p>
			<p>From thereupon do I this body bring.<br/>
			To tell you who I am were speech in vain,<br/>
			Because my name as yet makes no great noise."</p>
			<p>"If well thy meaning I can penetrate<br/>
			With intellect of mine," then answered me<br/>
			He who first spake, "thou speakest of the Arno."</p>
			<p>And said the other to him: "Why concealed<br/>
			This one the appellation of that river,<br/>
			Even as a man doth of things horrible?"</p>
			<p>And thus the shade that questioned was of this<br/>
			Himself acquitted: "I know not; but truly<br/>
			'Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;</p>
			<p>For from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant<br/>
			The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro<br/>
			That in few places it that mark surpasses)</p>
			<p>To where it yields itself in restoration<br/>
			Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,<br/>
			Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,</p>
			<p>Virtue is like an enemy avoided<br/>
			By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune<br/>
			Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;</p>
			<p>On which account have so transformed their nature<br/>
			The dwellers in that miserable valley,<br/>
			It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.</p>
			<p>'Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier<br/>
			Than other food for human use created,<br/>
			It first directeth its impoverished way.</p>
			<p>Curs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,<br/>
			More snarling than their puissance demands,<br/>
			And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.</p>
			<p>It goes on falling, and the more it grows,<br/>
			The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,<br/>
			This maledict and misadventurous ditch.</p>
			<p>Descended then through many a hollow gulf,<br/>
			It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,<br/>
			They fear no cunning that may master them.</p>
			<p>Nor will I cease because another hears me;<br/>
			And well 'twill be for him, if still he mind him<br/>
			Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.</p>
			<p>Thy grandson I behold, who doth become<br/>
			A hunter of those wolves upon the bank<br/>
			Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.</p>
			<p>He sells their flesh, it being yet alive;<br/>
			Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;<br/>
			Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.</p>
			<p>Blood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;<br/>
			He leaves it such, a thousand years from now<br/>
			In its primeval state 'tis not re-wooded."</p>
			<p>As at the announcement of impending ills<br/>
			The face of him who listens is disturbed,<br/>
			From whate'er side the peril seize upon him;</p>
			<p>So I beheld that other soul, which stood<br/>
			Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,<br/>
			When it had gathered to itself the word.</p>
			<p>The speech of one and aspect of the other<br/>
			Had me desirous made to know their names,<br/>
			And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,</p>
			<p>Whereat the spirit which first spake to me<br/>
			Began again: "Thou wishest I should bring me<br/>
			To do for thee what thou'lt not do for me;</p>
			<p>But since God willeth that in thee shine forth<br/>
			Such grace of his, I'll not be chary with thee;<br/>
			Know, then, that I Guido del Duca am.</p>
			<p>My blood was so with envy set on fire,<br/>
			That if I had beheld a man make merry,<br/>
			Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o'er with pallor.</p>
			<p>From my own sowing such the straw I reap!<br/>
			O human race! why dost thou set thy heart<br/>
			Where interdict of partnership must be?</p>
			<p>This is Renier; this is the boast and honour<br/>
			Of the house of Calboli, where no one since<br/>
			Has made himself the heir of his desert.</p>
			<p>And not alone his blood is made devoid,<br/>
			'Twixt Po and mount, and sea-shore and the Reno,<br/>
			Of good required for truth and for diversion;</p>
			<p>For all within these boundaries is full<br/>
			Of venomous roots, so that too tardily<br/>
			By cultivation now would they diminish.</p>
			<p>Where is good Lizio, and Arrigo Manardi,<br/>
			Pier Traversaro, and Guido di Carpigna,<br/>
			O Romagnuoli into bastards turned?</p>
			<p>When in Bologna will a Fabbro rise?<br/>
			When in Faenza a Bernardin di Fosco,<br/>
			The noble scion of ignoble seed?</p>
			<p>Be not astonished, Tuscan, if I weep,<br/>
			When I remember, with Guido da Prata,<br/>
			Ugolin d' Azzo, who was living with us,</p>
			<p>Frederick Tignoso and his company,<br/>
			The house of Traversara, and th' Anastagi,<br/>
			And one race and the other is extinct;</p>
			<p>The dames and cavaliers, the toils and ease<br/>
			That filled our souls with love and courtesy,<br/>
			There where the hearts have so malicious grown!</p>
			<p>O Brettinoro! why dost thou not flee,<br/>
			Seeing that all thy family is gone,<br/>
			And many people, not to be corrupted?</p>
			<p>Bagnacaval does well in not begetting<br/>
			And ill does Castrocaro, and Conio worse,<br/>
			In taking trouble to beget such Counts.</p>
			<p>Will do well the Pagani, when their Devil<br/>
			Shall have departed; but not therefore pure<br/>
			Will testimony of them e'er remain.</p>
			<p>O Ugolin de' Fantoli, secure<br/>
			Thy name is, since no longer is awaited<br/>
			One who, degenerating, can obscure it!</p>
			<p>But go now, Tuscan, for it now delights me<br/>
			To weep far better than it does to speak,<br/>
			So much has our discourse my mind distressed."</p>
			<p>We were aware that those beloved souls<br/>
			Heard us depart; therefore, by keeping silent,<br/>
			They made us of our pathway confident.</p>
			<p>When we became alone by going onward,<br/>
			Thunder, when it doth cleave the air, appeared<br/>
			A voice, that counter to us came, exclaiming:</p>
			<p>"Shall slay me whosoever findeth me!"<br/>
			And fled as the reverberation dies<br/>
			If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts.</p>
			<p>As soon as hearing had a truce from this,<br/>
			Behold another, with so great a crash,<br/>
			That it resembled thunderings following fast:</p>
			<p>"I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!"<br/>
			And then, to press myself close to the Poet,<br/>
			I backward, and not forward, took a step.</p>
			<p>Already on all sides the air was quiet;<br/>
			And said he to me: "That was the hard curb<br/>
			That ought to hold a man within his bounds;</p>
			<p>But you take in the bait so that the hook<br/>
			Of the old Adversary draws you to him,<br/>
			And hence availeth little curb or call.</p>
			<p>The heavens are calling you, and wheel around you,<br/>

			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">As much as 'twixt the close of the third hour<br/>
			And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere<br/>
			Which aye in fashion of a child is playing,</p>
			<p>So much it now appeared, towards the night,<br/>
			Was of his course remaining to the sun;<br/>
			There it was evening, and 'twas midnight here;</p>
			<p>And the rays smote the middle of our faces,<br/>
			Because by us the mount was so encircled,<br/>
			That straight towards the west we now were going</p>
			<p>When I perceived my forehead overpowered<br/>
			Beneath the splendour far more than at first,<br/>
			And stupor were to me the things unknown,</p>
			<p>Whereat towards the summit of my brow<br/>
			I raised my hands, and made myself the visor<br/>
			Which the excessive glare diminishes.</p>
			<p>As when from off the water, or a mirror,<br/>
			The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side,<br/>
			Ascending upward in the selfsame measure</p>
			<p>That it descends, and deviates as far<br/>
			From falling of a stone in line direct,<br/>
			(As demonstrate experiment and art,)</p>
			<p>So it appeared to me that by a light<br/>
			Refracted there before me I was smitten;<br/>
			On which account my sight was swift to flee.</p>
			<p>"What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot<br/>
			So fully screen my sight that it avail me,"<br/>
			Said I, "and seems towards us to be moving?"</p>
			<p>"Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet<br/>
			The family of heaven," he answered me;<br/>
			"An angel 'tis, who comes to invite us upward.</p>
			<p>Soon will it be, that to behold these things<br/>
			Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee<br/>
			As much as nature fashioned thee to feel."</p>
			<p>When we had reached the Angel benedight,<br/>
			With joyful voice he said: "Here enter in<br/>
			To stairway far less steep than are the others."</p>
			<p>We mounting were, already thence departed,<br/>
			And "Beati misericordes" was<br/>
			Behind us sung, "Rejoice, thou that o'ercomest!"</p>
			<p>My Master and myself, we two alone<br/>
			Were going upward, and I thought, in going,<br/>
			Some profit to acquire from words of his;</p>
			<p>And I to him directed me, thus asking:<br/>
			"What did the spirit of Romagna mean,<br/>
			Mentioning interdict and partnership?"</p>
			<p>Whence he to me: "Of his own greatest failing<br/>
			He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not<br/>
			If he reprove us, that we less may rue it.</p>
			<p>Because are thither pointed your desires<br/>
			Where by companionship each share is lessened,<br/>
			Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs.</p>
			<p>But if the love of the supernal sphere<br/>
			Should upwardly direct your aspiration,<br/>
			There would not be that fear within your breast;</p>
			<p>For there, as much the more as one says 'Our,'<br/>
			So much the more of good each one possesses,<br/>
			And more of charity in that cloister burns."</p>
			<p>"I am more hungering to be satisfied,"<br/>
			I said, "than if I had before been silent,<br/>
			And more of doubt within my mind I gather.</p>
			<p>How can it be, that boon distributed<br/>
			The more possessors can more wealthy make<br/>
			Therein, than if by few it be possessed?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Because thou fixest still<br/>
			Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,<br/>
			Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.</p>
			<p>That goodness infinite and ineffable<br/>
			Which is above there, runneth unto love,<br/>
			As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.</p>
			<p>So much it gives itself as it finds ardour,<br/>
			So that as far as charity extends,<br/>
			O'er it increases the eternal valour.</p>
			<p>And the more people thitherward aspire,<br/>
			More are there to love well, and more they love there,<br/>
			And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.</p>
			<p>And if my reasoning appease thee not,<br/>
			Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully<br/>
			Take from thee this and every other longing.</p>
			<p>Endeavour, then, that soon may be extinct,<br/>
			As are the two already, the five wounds<br/>
			That close themselves again by being painful."</p>
			<p>Even as I wished to say, "Thou dost appease me,"<br/>
			I saw that I had reached another circle,<br/>
			So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.</p>
			<p>There it appeared to me that in a vision<br/>
			Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,<br/>
			And in a temple many persons saw;</p>
			<p>And at the door a woman, with the sweet<br/>
			Behaviour of a mother, saying: "Son,<br/>
			Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?</p>
			<p>Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself<br/>
			Were seeking for thee;"—and as here she ceased,<br/>
			That which appeared at first had disappeared.</p>
			<p>Then I beheld another with those waters<br/>
			Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever<br/>
			From great disdain of others it is born,</p>
			<p>And saying: "If of that city thou art lord,<br/>
			For whose name was such strife among the gods,<br/>
			And whence doth every science scintillate,</p>
			<p>Avenge thyself on those audacious arms<br/>
			That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;"<br/>
			And the lord seemed to me benign and mild</p>
			<p>To answer her with aspect temperate:<br/>
			"What shall we do to those who wish us ill,<br/>
			If he who loves us be by us condemned?"</p>
			<p>Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,<br/>
			With stones a young man slaying, clamorously<br/>
			Still crying to each other, "Kill him! kill him!"</p>
			<p>And him I saw bow down, because of death<br/>
			That weighed already on him, to the earth,<br/>
			But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,</p>
			<p>Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,<br/>
			That he would pardon those his persecutors,<br/>
			With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.</p>
			<p>Soon as my soul had outwardly returned<br/>
			To things external to it which are true,<br/>
			Did I my not false errors recognize.</p>
			<p>My Leader, who could see me bear myself<br/>
			Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,<br/>
			Exclaimed: "What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?</p>
			<p>But hast been coming more than half a league<br/>
			Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,<br/>
			In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?"</p>
			<p>"O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,<br/>
			I'll tell thee," said I, "what appeared to me,<br/>
			When thus from me my legs were ta'en away."</p>
			<p>And he: "If thou shouldst have a hundred masks<br/>
			Upon thy face, from me would not be shut<br/>
			Thy cogitations, howsoever small.</p>
			<p>What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail<br/>
			To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,<br/>
			Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.</p>
			<p>I did not ask, 'What ails thee?' as he does<br/>
			Who only looketh with the eyes that see not<br/>
			When of the soul bereft the body lies,</p>
			<p>But asked it to give vigour to thy feet;<br/>
			Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow<br/>
			To use their wakefulness when it returns."</p>
			<p>We passed along, athwart the twilight peering<br/>
			Forward as far as ever eye could stretch<br/>
			Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;</p>
			<p>And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached<br/>
			In our direction, sombre as the night,<br/>
			Nor was there place to hide one's self therefrom.</p>
			<p>This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XVI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived<br/>
			Of every planet under a poor sky,<br/>
			As much as may be tenebrous with cloud,</p>
			<p>Ne'er made unto my sight so thick a veil,<br/>
			As did that smoke which there enveloped us,<br/>
			Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;</p>
			<p>For not an eye it suffered to stay open;<br/>
			Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,<br/>
			Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.</p>
			<p>E'en as a blind man goes behind his guide,<br/>
			Lest he should wander, or should strike against<br/>
			Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,</p>
			<p>So went I through the bitter and foul air,<br/>
			Listening unto my Leader, who said only,<br/>
			"Look that from me thou be not separated."</p>
			<p>Voices I heard, and every one appeared<br/>
			To supplicate for peace and misericord<br/>
			The Lamb of God who takes away our sins.</p>
			<p>Still "Agnus Dei" their exordium was;<br/>
			One word there was in all, and metre one,<br/>
			So that all harmony appeared among them.</p>
			<p>"Master," I said, "are spirits those I hear?"<br/>
			And he to me: "Thou apprehendest truly,<br/>
			And they the knot of anger go unloosing."</p>
			<p>"Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke<br/>
			And art discoursing of us even as though<br/>
			Thou didst by calends still divide the time?"</p>
			<p>After this manner by a voice was spoken;<br/>
			Whereon my Master said: "Do thou reply,<br/>
			And ask if on this side the way go upward."</p>
			<p>And I: "O creature that dost cleanse thyself<br/>
			To return beautiful to Him who made thee,<br/>
			Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me."</p>
			<p>"Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,"<br/>
			He answered; "and if smoke prevent our seeing,<br/>
			Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof."</p>
			<p>Thereon began I: "With that swathing band<br/>
			Which death unwindeth am I going upward,<br/>
			And hither came I through the infernal anguish.</p>
			<p>And if God in his grace has me infolded,<br/>
			So that he wills that I behold his court<br/>
			By method wholly out of modern usage,</p>
			<p>Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,<br/>
			But tell it me, and tell me if I go<br/>
			Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort."</p>
			<p>"Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;<br/>
			The world I knew, and loved that excellence,<br/>
			At which has each one now unbent his bow.</p>
			<p>For mounting upward, thou art going right."<br/>
			Thus he made answer, and subjoined: "I pray thee<br/>
			To pray for me when thou shalt be above."</p>
			<p>And I to him: "My faith I pledge to thee<br/>
			To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting<br/>
			Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.</p>
			<p>First it was simple, and is now made double<br/>
			By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,<br/>
			Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.</p>
			<p>The world forsooth is utterly deserted<br/>
			By every virtue, as thou tellest me,<br/>
			And with iniquity is big and covered;</p>
			<p>But I beseech thee point me out the cause,<br/>
			That I may see it, and to others show it;<br/>
			For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it."</p>
			<p>A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!<br/>
			He first sent forth, and then began he: "Brother,<br/>
			The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!</p>
			<p>Ye who are living every cause refer<br/>
			Still upward to the heavens, as if all things<br/>
			They of necessity moved with themselves.</p>
			<p>If this were so, in you would be destroyed<br/>
			Free will, nor any justice would there be<br/>
			In having joy for good, or grief for evil.</p>
			<p>The heavens your movements do initiate,<br/>
			I say not all; but granting that I say it,<br/>
			Light has been given you for good and evil,</p>
			<p>And free volition; which, if some fatigue<br/>
			In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,<br/>
			Afterwards conquers all, if well 'tis nurtured.</p>
			<p>To greater force and to a better nature,<br/>
			Though free, ye subject are, and that creates<br/>
			The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.</p>
			<p>Hence, if the present world doth go astray,<br/>
			In you the cause is, be it sought in you;<br/>
			And I therein will now be thy true spy.</p>
			<p>Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it<br/>
			Before it is, like to a little girl<br/>
			Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,</p>
			<p>Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,<br/>
			Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,<br/>
			Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.</p>
			<p>Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour;<br/>
			Is cheated by it, and runs after it,<br/>
			If guide or rein turn not aside its love.</p>
			<p>Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,<br/>
			Behoved a king to have, who at the least<br/>
			Of the true city should discern the tower.</p>
			<p>The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?<br/>
			No one; because the shepherd who precedes<br/>
			Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;</p>
			<p>Wherefore the people that perceives its guide<br/>
			Strike only at the good for which it hankers,<br/>
			Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.</p>
			<p>Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance<br/>
			The cause is that has made the world depraved,<br/>
			And not that nature is corrupt in you.</p>
			<p>Rome, that reformed the world, accustomed was<br/>
			Two suns to have, which one road and the other,<br/>
			Of God and of the world, made manifest.</p>
			<p>One has the other quenched, and to the crosier<br/>
			The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it<br/>
			That by main force one with the other go,</p>
			<p>Because, being joined, one feareth not the other;<br/>
			If thou believe not, think upon the grain,<br/>
			For by its seed each herb is recognized.</p>
			<p>In the land laved by Po and Adige,<br/>
			Valour and courtesy used to be found,<br/>
			Before that Frederick had his controversy;</p>
			<p>Now in security can pass that way<br/>
			Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,<br/>
			From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.</p>
			<p>True, three old men are left, in whom upbraids<br/>
			The ancient age the new, and late they deem it<br/>
			That God restore them to the better life:</p>
			<p>Currado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo,<br/>
			And Guido da Castel, who better named is,<br/>
			In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard:</p>
			<p>Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,<br/>
			Confounding in itself two governments,<br/>
			Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden."</p>
			<p>"O Marco mine," I said, "thou reasonest well;<br/>
			And now discern I why the sons of Levi<br/>
			Have been excluded from the heritage.</p>
			<p>But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample<br/>
			Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained<br/>
			In reprobation of the barbarous age?"</p>
			<p>"Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,"<br/>
			He answered me; "for speaking Tuscan to me,<br/>
			It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.</p>
			<p>By other surname do I know him not,<br/>
			Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.<br/>
			May God be with you, for I come no farther.</p>
			<p>Behold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,<br/>
			Already whitening; and I must depart—<br/>
			Yonder the Angel is—ere he appear."</p>
			<p>Thus did he speak, and would no farther hear me.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XVII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Remember, Reader, if e'er in the Alps<br/>
			A mist o'ertook thee, through which thou couldst see<br/>
			Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,</p>
			<p>How, when the vapours humid and condensed<br/>
			Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere<br/>
			Of the sun feebly enters in among them,</p>
			<p>And thy imagination will be swift<br/>
			In coming to perceive how I re-saw<br/>
			The sun at first, that was already setting.</p>
			<p>Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master<br/>
			Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud<br/>
			To rays already dead on the low shores.</p>
			<p>O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us<br/>
			So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,<br/>
			Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,</p>
			<p>Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?<br/>
			Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,<br/>
			By self, or by a will that downward guides it.</p>
			<p>Of her impiety, who changed her form<br/>
			Into the bird that most delights in singing,<br/>
			In my imagining appeared the trace;</p>
			<p>And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn<br/>
			Within itself, that from without there came<br/>
			Nothing that then might be received by it.</p>
			<p>Then reigned within my lofty fantasy<br/>
			One crucified, disdainful and ferocious<br/>
			In countenance, and even thus was dying.</p>
			<p>Around him were the great Ahasuerus,<br/>
			Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,<br/>
			Who was in word and action so entire.</p>
			<p>And even as this image burst asunder<br/>
			Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble<br/>
			In which the water it was made of fails,</p>
			<p>There rose up in my vision a young maiden<br/>
			Bitterly weeping, and she said: "O queen,<br/>
			Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?</p>
			<p>Thou'st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;<br/>
			Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,<br/>
			Mother, at thine ere at another's ruin."</p>
			<p>As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden<br/>
			New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,<br/>
			And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,</p>
			<p>So this imagining of mine fell down<br/>
			As soon as the effulgence smote my face,<br/>
			Greater by far than what is in our wont.</p>
			<p>I turned me round to see where I might be,<br/>
			When said a voice, "Here is the passage up;"<br/>
			Which from all other purposes removed me,</p>
			<p>And made my wish so full of eagerness<br/>
			To look and see who was it that was speaking,<br/>
			It never rests till meeting face to face;</p>
			<p>But as before the sun, which quells the sight,<br/>
			And in its own excess its figure veils,<br/>
			Even so my power was insufficient here.</p>
			<p>"This is a spirit divine, who in the way<br/>
			Of going up directs us without asking,<br/>
			And who with his own light himself conceals.</p>
			<p>He does with us as man doth with himself;<br/>
			For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,<br/>
			Malignly leans already tow'rds denial.</p>
			<p>Accord we now our feet to such inviting,<br/>
			Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;<br/>
			For then we could not till the day return."</p>
			<p>Thus my Conductor said; and I and he<br/>
			Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;<br/>
			And I, as soon as the first step I reached,</p>
			<p>Near me perceived a motion as of wings,<br/>
			And fanning in the face, and saying, "'Beati<br/>
			Pacifici,' who are without ill anger."</p>
			<p>Already over us were so uplifted<br/>
			The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,<br/>
			That upon many sides the stars appeared.</p>
			<p>"O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?"<br/>
			I said within myself; for I perceived<br/>
			The vigour of my legs was put in truce.</p>
			<p>We at the point were where no more ascends<br/>
			The stairway upward, and were motionless,<br/>
			Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;</p>
			<p>And I gave heed a little, if I might hear<br/>
			Aught whatsoever in the circle new;<br/>
			Then to my Master turned me round and said:</p>
			<p>"Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency<br/>
			Is purged here in the circle where we are?<br/>
			Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "The love of good, remiss<br/>
			In what it should have done, is here restored;<br/>
			Here plied again the ill-belated oar;</p>
			<p>But still more openly to understand,<br/>
			Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather<br/>
			Some profitable fruit from our delay.</p>
			<p>Neither Creator nor a creature ever,<br/>
			Son," he began, "was destitute of love<br/>
			Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.</p>
			<p>The natural was ever without error;<br/>
			But err the other may by evil object,<br/>
			Or by too much, or by too little vigour.</p>
			<p>While in the first it well directed is,<br/>
			And in the second moderates itself,<br/>
			It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;</p>
			<p>But when to ill it turns, and, with more care<br/>
			Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,<br/>
			'Gainst the Creator works his own creation.</p>
			<p>Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be<br/>
			The seed within yourselves of every virtue,<br/>
			And every act that merits punishment.</p>
			<p>Now inasmuch as never from the welfare<br/>
			Of its own subject can love turn its sight,<br/>
			From their own hatred all things are secure;</p>
			<p>And since we cannot think of any being<br/>
			Standing alone, nor from the First divided,<br/>
			Of hating Him is all desire cut off.</p>
			<p>Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,<br/>
			The evil that one loves is of one's neighbour,<br/>
			And this is born in three modes in your clay.</p>
			<p>There are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,<br/>
			Hope to excel, and therefore only long<br/>
			That from his greatness he may be cast down;</p>
			<p>There are, who power, grace, honour, and renown<br/>
			Fear they may lose because another rises,<br/>
			Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;</p>
			<p>And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,<br/>
			So that it makes them greedy for revenge,<br/>
			And such must needs shape out another's harm.</p>
			<p>This threefold love is wept for down below;<br/>
			Now of the other will I have thee hear,<br/>
			That runneth after good with measure faulty.</p>
			<p>Each one confusedly a good conceives<br/>
			Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;<br/>
			Therefore to overtake it each one strives.</p>
			<p>If languid love to look on this attract you,<br/>
			Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,<br/>
			After just penitence, torments you for it.</p>
			<p>There's other good that does not make man happy;<br/>
			'Tis not felicity, 'tis not the good<br/>
			Essence, of every good the fruit and root.</p>
			<p>The love that yields itself too much to this<br/>
			Above us is lamented in three circles;<br/>
			But how tripartite it may be described,</p>
			<p>I say not, that thou seek it for thyself."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XVIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">An end had put unto his reasoning<br/>
			The lofty Teacher, and attent was looking<br/>
			Into my face, if I appeared content;</p>
			<p>And I, whom a new thirst still goaded on,<br/>
			Without was mute, and said within: "Perchance<br/>
			The too much questioning I make annoys him."</p>
			<p>But that true Father, who had comprehended<br/>
			The timid wish, that opened not itself,<br/>
			By speaking gave me hardihood to speak.</p>
			<p>Whence I: "My sight is, Master, vivified<br/>
			So in thy light, that clearly I discern<br/>
			Whate'er thy speech importeth or describes.</p>
			<p>Therefore I thee entreat, sweet Father dear,<br/>
			To teach me love, to which thou dost refer<br/>
			Every good action and its contrary."</p>
			<p>"Direct," he said, "towards me the keen eyes<br/>
			Of intellect, and clear will be to thee<br/>
			The error of the blind, who would be leaders.</p>
			<p>The soul, which is created apt to love,<br/>
			Is mobile unto everything that pleases,<br/>
			Soon as by pleasure she is waked to action.</p>
			<p>Your apprehension from some real thing<br/>
			An image draws, and in yourselves displays it<br/>
			So that it makes the soul turn unto it.</p>
			<p>And if, when turned, towards it she incline,<br/>
			Love is that inclination; it is nature,<br/>
			Which is by pleasure bound in you anew</p>
			<p>Then even as the fire doth upward move<br/>
			By its own form, which to ascend is born,<br/>
			Where longest in its matter it endures,</p>
			<p>So comes the captive soul into desire,<br/>
			Which is a motion spiritual, and ne'er rests<br/>
			Until she doth enjoy the thing beloved.</p>
			<p>Now may apparent be to thee how hidden<br/>
			The truth is from those people, who aver<br/>
			All love is in itself a laudable thing;</p>
			<p>Because its matter may perchance appear<br/>
			Aye to be good; but yet not each impression<br/>
			Is good, albeit good may be the wax."</p>
			<p>"Thy words, and my sequacious intellect,"<br/>
			I answered him, "have love revealed to me;<br/>
			But that has made me more impregned with doubt;</p>
			<p>For if love from without be offered us,<br/>
			And with another foot the soul go not,<br/>
			If right or wrong she go, 'tis not her merit."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "What reason seeth here,<br/>
			Myself can tell thee; beyond that await<br/>
			For Beatrice, since 'tis a work of faith.</p>
			<p>Every substantial form, that segregate<br/>
			From matter is, and with it is united,<br/>
			Specific power has in itself collected,</p>
			<p>Which without act is not perceptible,<br/>
			Nor shows itself except by its effect,<br/>
			As life does in a plant by the green leaves.</p>
			<p>But still, whence cometh the intelligence<br/>
			Of the first notions, man is ignorant,<br/>
			And the affection for the first allurements,</p>
			<p>Which are in you as instinct in the bee<br/>
			To make its honey; and this first desire<br/>
			Merit of praise or blame containeth not.</p>
			<p>Now, that to this all others may be gathered,<br/>
			Innate within you is the power that counsels,<br/>
			And it should keep the threshold of assent.</p>
			<p>This is the principle, from which is taken<br/>
			Occasion of desert in you, according<br/>
			As good and guilty loves it takes and winnows.</p>
			<p>Those who, in reasoning, to the bottom went,<br/>
			Were of this innate liberty aware,<br/>
			Therefore bequeathed they Ethics to the world.</p>
			<p>Supposing, then, that from necessity<br/>
			Springs every love that is within you kindled,<br/>
			Within yourselves the power is to restrain it.</p>
			<p>The noble virtue Beatrice understands<br/>
			By the free will; and therefore see that thou<br/>
			Bear it in mind, if she should speak of it."</p>
			<p>The moon, belated almost unto midnight,<br/>
			Now made the stars appear to us more rare,<br/>
			Formed like a bucket, that is all ablaze,</p>
			<p>And counter to the heavens ran through those paths<br/>
			Which the sun sets aflame, when he of Rome<br/>
			Sees it 'twixt Sardes and Corsicans go down;</p>
			<p>And that patrician shade, for whom is named<br/>
			Pietola more than any Mantuan town,<br/>
			Had laid aside the burden of my lading;</p>
			<p>Whence I, who reason manifest and plain<br/>
			In answer to my questions had received,<br/>
			Stood like a man in drowsy reverie.</p>
			<p>But taken from me was this drowsiness<br/>
			Suddenly by a people, that behind<br/>
			Our backs already had come round to us.</p>
			<p>And as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus<br/>
			Beside them saw at night the rush and throng,<br/>
			If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus,</p>
			<p>So they along that circle curve their step,<br/>
			From what I saw of those approaching us,<br/>
			Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden.</p>
			<p>Full soon they were upon us, because running<br/>
			Moved onward all that mighty multitude,<br/>
			And two in the advance cried out, lamenting,</p>
			<p>"Mary in haste unto the mountain ran,<br/>
			And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,<br/>
			Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain."</p>
			<p>"Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost<br/>
			By little love!" forthwith the others cried,<br/>
			"For ardour in well-doing freshens grace!"</p>
			<p>"O folk, in whom an eager fervour now<br/>
			Supplies perhaps delay and negligence,<br/>
			Put by you in well-doing, through lukewarmness,</p>
			<p>This one who lives, and truly I lie not,<br/>
			Would fain go up, if but the sun relight us;<br/>
			So tell us where the passage nearest is."</p>
			<p>These were the words of him who was my Guide;<br/>
			And some one of those spirits said: "Come on<br/>
			Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find;</p>
			<p>So full of longing are we to move onward,<br/>
			That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us,<br/>
			If thou for churlishness our justice take.</p>
			<p>I was San Zeno's Abbot at Verona,<br/>
			Under the empire of good Barbarossa,<br/>
			Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse;</p>
			<p>And he has one foot in the grave already,<br/>
			Who shall erelong lament that monastery,<br/>
			And sorry be of having there had power,</p>
			<p>Because his son, in his whole body sick,<br/>
			And worse in mind, and who was evil-born,<br/>
			He put into the place of its true pastor."</p>
			<p>If more he said, or silent was, I know not,<br/>
			He had already passed so far beyond us;<br/>
			But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me.</p>
			<p>And he who was in every need my succour<br/>
			Said: "Turn thee hitherward; see two of them<br/>
			Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth."</p>
			<p>In rear of all they shouted: "Sooner were<br/>
			The people dead to whom the sea was opened,<br/>
			Than their inheritors the Jordan saw;</p>
			<p>And those who the fatigue did not endure<br/>
			Unto the issue, with Anchises' son,<br/>
			Themselves to life withouten glory offered."</p>
			<p>Then when from us so separated were<br/>
			Those shades, that they no longer could be seen,<br/>
			Within me a new thought did entrance find,</p>
			<p>Whence others many and diverse were born;<br/>
			And so I lapsed from one into another,<br/>
			That in a reverie mine eyes I closed,</p>
			<p>And meditation into dream transmuted.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XIX</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">It was the hour when the diurnal heat<br/>
			No more can warm the coldness of the moon,<br/>
			Vanquished by earth, or peradventure Saturn,</p>
			<p>When geomancers their Fortuna Major<br/>
			See in the orient before the dawn<br/>
			Rise by a path that long remains not dim,</p>
			<p>There came to me in dreams a stammering woman,<br/>
			Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted,<br/>
			With hands dissevered and of sallow hue.</p>
			<p>I looked at her; and as the sun restores<br/>
			The frigid members which the night benumbs,<br/>
			Even thus my gaze did render voluble</p>
			<p>Her tongue, and made her all erect thereafter<br/>
			In little while, and the lost countenance<br/>
			As love desires it so in her did colour.</p>
			<p>When in this wise she had her speech unloosed,<br/>
			She 'gan to sing so, that with difficulty<br/>
			Could I have turned my thoughts away from her.</p>
			<p>"I am," she sang, "I am the Siren sweet<br/>
			Who mariners amid the main unman,<br/>
			So full am I of pleasantness to hear.</p>
			<p>I drew Ulysses from his wandering way<br/>
			Unto my song, and he who dwells with me<br/>
			Seldom departs so wholly I content him."</p>
			<p>Her mouth was not yet closed again, before<br/>
			Appeared a Lady saintly and alert<br/>
			Close at my side to put her to confusion.</p>
			<p>"Virgilius, O Virgilius! who is this?"<br/>
			Sternly she said; and he was drawing near<br/>
			With eyes still fixed upon that modest one.</p>
			<p>She seized the other and in front laid open,<br/>
			Rending her garments, and her belly showed me;<br/>
			This waked me with the stench that issued from it.</p>
			<p>I turned mine eyes, and good Virgilius said:<br/>
			"At least thrice have I called thee; rise and come;<br/>
			Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter."</p>
			<p>I rose; and full already of high day<br/>
			Were all the circles of the Sacred Mountain,<br/>
			And with the new sun at our back we went.</p>
			<p>Following behind him, I my forehead bore<br/>
			Like unto one who has it laden with thought,<br/>
			Who makes himself the half arch of a bridge,</p>
			<p>When I heard say, "Come, here the passage is,"<br/>
			Spoken in a manner gentle and benign,<br/>
			Such as we hear not in this mortal region.</p>
			<p>With open wings, which of a swan appeared,<br/>
			Upward he turned us who thus spake to us,<br/>
			Between the two walls of the solid granite.</p>
			<p>He moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us,<br/>
			Affirming those 'qui lugent' to be blessed,<br/>
			For they shall have their souls with comfort filled.</p>
			<p>"What aileth thee, that aye to earth thou gazest?"<br/>
			To me my Guide began to say, we both<br/>
			Somewhat beyond the Angel having mounted.</p>
			<p>And I: "With such misgiving makes me go<br/>
			A vision new, which bends me to itself,<br/>
			So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me."</p>
			<p>"Didst thou behold," he said, "that old enchantress,<br/>
			Who sole above us henceforth is lamented?<br/>
			Didst thou behold how man is freed from her?</p>
			<p>Suffice it thee, and smite earth with thy heels,<br/>
			Thine eyes lift upward to the lure, that whirls<br/>
			The Eternal King with revolutions vast."</p>
			<p>Even as the hawk, that first his feet surveys,<br/>
			Then turns him to the call and stretches forward,<br/>
			Through the desire of food that draws him thither,</p>
			<p>Such I became, and such, as far as cleaves<br/>
			The rock to give a way to him who mounts,<br/>
			Went on to where the circling doth begin.</p>
			<p>On the fifth circle when I had come forth,<br/>
			People I saw upon it who were weeping,<br/>
			Stretched prone upon the ground, all downward turned.</p>
			<p>"Adhaesit pavimento anima mea,"<br/>
			I heard them say with sighings so profound,<br/>
			That hardly could the words be understood.</p>
			<p>"O ye elect of God, whose sufferings<br/>
			Justice and Hope both render less severe,<br/>
			Direct ye us towards the high ascents."</p>
			<p>"If ye are come secure from this prostration,<br/>
			And wish to find the way most speedily,<br/>
			Let your right hands be evermore outside."</p>
			<p>Thus did the Poet ask, and thus was answered<br/>
			By them somewhat in front of us; whence I<br/>
			In what was spoken divined the rest concealed,</p>
			<p>And unto my Lord's eyes mine eyes I turned;<br/>
			Whence he assented with a cheerful sign<br/>
			To what the sight of my desire implored.</p>
			<p>When of myself I could dispose at will,<br/>
			Above that creature did I draw myself,<br/>
			Whose words before had caused me to take note,</p>
			<p>Saying: "O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens<br/>
			That without which to God we cannot turn,<br/>
			Suspend awhile for me thy greater care.</p>
			<p>Who wast thou, and why are your backs turned upwards,<br/>
			Tell me, and if thou wouldst that I procure thee<br/>
			Anything there whence living I departed."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Wherefore our backs the heaven<br/>
			Turns to itself, know shalt thou; but beforehand<br/>
			'Scias quod ego fui successor Petri.'</p>
			<p>Between Siestri and Chiaveri descends<br/>
			A river beautiful, and of its name<br/>
			The title of my blood its summit makes.</p>
			<p>A month and little more essayed I how<br/>
			Weighs the great cloak on him from mire who keeps it,<br/>
			For all the other burdens seem a feather.</p>
			<p>Tardy, ah woe is me! was my conversion;<br/>
			But when the Roman Shepherd I was made,<br/>
			Then I discovered life to be a lie.</p>
			<p>I saw that there the heart was not at rest,<br/>
			Nor farther in that life could one ascend;<br/>
			Whereby the love of this was kindled in me.</p>
			<p>Until that time a wretched soul and parted<br/>
			From God was I, and wholly avaricious;<br/>
			Now, as thou seest, I here am punished for it.</p>
			<p>What avarice does is here made manifest<br/>
			In the purgation of these souls converted,<br/>
			And no more bitter pain the Mountain has.</p>
			<p>Even as our eye did not uplift itself<br/>
			Aloft, being fastened upon earthly things,<br/>
			So justice here has merged it in the earth.</p>
			<p>As avarice had extinguished our affection<br/>
			For every good, whereby was action lost,<br/>
			So justice here doth hold us in restraint,</p>
			<p>Bound and imprisoned by the feet and hands;<br/>
			And so long as it pleases the just Lord<br/>
			Shall we remain immovable and prostrate."</p>
			<p>I on my knees had fallen, and wished to speak;<br/>
			But even as I began, and he was 'ware,<br/>
			Only by listening, of my reverence,</p>
			<p>"What cause," he said, "has downward bent thee thus?"<br/>
			And I to him: "For your own dignity,<br/>
			Standing, my conscience stung me with remorse."</p>
			<p>"Straighten thy legs, and upward raise thee, brother,"<br/>
			He answered: "Err not, fellow-servant am I<br/>
			With thee and with the others to one power.</p>
			<p>If e'er that holy, evangelic sound,<br/>
			Which sayeth 'neque nubent,' thou hast heard,<br/>
			Well canst thou see why in this wise I speak.</p>
			<p>Now go; no longer will I have thee linger,<br/>
			Because thy stay doth incommode my weeping,<br/>
			With which I ripen that which thou hast said.</p>
			<p>On earth I have a grandchild named Alagia,<br/>
			Good in herself, unless indeed our house<br/>
			Malevolent may make her by example,</p>
			<p>And she alone remains to me on earth."</p>

			<p>Hugh Capet was I called upon the earth;<br/>
			From me were born the Louises and Philips,<br/>
			By whom in later days has France been governed.</p>
			<p>I was the son of a Parisian butcher,<br/>
			What time the ancient kings had perished all,<br/>
			Excepting one, contrite in cloth of gray.</p>
			<p>I found me grasping in my hands the rein<br/>
			Of the realm's government, and so great power<br/>
			Of new acquest, and so with friends abounding,</p>
			<p>That to the widowed diadem promoted<br/>
			The head of mine own offspring was, from whom<br/>
			The consecrated bones of these began.</p>
			<p>So long as the great dowry of Provence<br/>
			Out of my blood took not the sense of shame,<br/>
			'Twas little worth, but still it did no harm.</p>
			<p>Then it began with falsehood and with force<br/>
			Its rapine; and thereafter, for amends,<br/>
			Took Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony.</p>
			<p>Charles came to Italy, and for amends<br/>
			A victim made of Conradin, and then<br/>
			Thrust Thomas back to heaven, for amends.</p>
			<p>A time I see, not very distant now,<br/>
			Which draweth forth another Charles from France,<br/>
			The better to make known both him and his.</p>
			<p>Unarmed he goes, and only with the lance<br/>
			That Judas jousted with; and that he thrusts<br/>
			So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst.</p>
			<p>He thence not land, but sin and infamy,<br/>
			Shall gain, so much more grievous to himself<br/>
			As the more light such damage he accounts.</p>
			<p>The other, now gone forth, ta'en in his ship,<br/>

			It careth not for its own proper flesh?</p>

			And between living thieves I see him slain.</p>
			<p>I see the modern Pilate so relentless,<br/>

			He to the temple bears his sordid sails!</p>
			<p>When, O my Lord! shall I be joyful made<br/>
			By looking on the vengeance which, concealed,<br/>
			Makes sweet thine anger in thy secrecy?</p>
			<p>What I was saying of that only bride<br/>
			Of the Holy Ghost, and which occasioned thee<br/>
			To turn towards me for some commentary,</p>
			<p>So long has been ordained to all our prayers<br/>
			As the day lasts; but when the night comes on,<br/>
			Contrary sound we take instead thereof.</p>
			<p>At that time we repeat Pygmalion,<br/>
			Of whom a traitor, thief, and parricide<br/>
			Made his insatiable desire of gold;</p>
			<p>And the misery of avaricious Midas,<br/>
			That followed his inordinate demand,<br/>
			At which forevermore one needs but laugh.</p>
			<p>The foolish Achan each one then records,<br/>
			And how he stole the spoils; so that the wrath<br/>
			Of Joshua still appears to sting him here.</p>
			<p>Then we accuse Sapphira with her husband,<br/>
			We laud the hoof-beats Heliodorus had,<br/>
			And the whole mount in infamy encircles</p>
			<p>Polymnestor who murdered Polydorus.<br/>
			Here finally is cried: 'O Crassus, tell us,<br/>
			For thou dost know, what is the taste of gold?'</p>
			<p>Sometimes we speak, one loud, another low,<br/>
			According to desire of speech, that spurs us<br/>
			To greater now and now to lesser pace.</p>
			<p>But in the good that here by day is talked of,<br/>
			Erewhile alone I was not; yet near by<br/>
			No other person lifted up his voice."</p>
			<p>From him already we departed were,<br/>
			And made endeavour to o'ercome the road<br/>
			As much as was permitted to our power,</p>
			<p>When I perceived, like something that is falling,<br/>
			The mountain tremble, whence a chill seized on me,<br/>
			As seizes him who to his death is going.</p>
			<p>Certes so violently shook not Delos,<br/>
			Before Latona made her nest therein<br/>
			To give birth to the two eyes of the heaven.</p>
			<p>Then upon all sides there began a cry,<br/>
			Such that the Master drew himself towards me,<br/>
			Saying, "Fear not, while I am guiding thee."</p>
			<p>"Gloria in excelsis Deo," all<br/>
			Were saying, from what near I comprehended,<br/>
			Where it was possible to hear the cry.</p>
			<p>We paused immovable and in suspense,<br/>
			Even as the shepherds who first heard that song,<br/>
			Until the trembling ceased, and it was finished.</p>
			<p>Then we resumed again our holy path,<br/>
			Watching the shades that lay upon the ground,<br/>
			Already turned to their accustomed plaint.</p>
			<p>No ignorance ever with so great a strife<br/>
			Had rendered me importunate to know,<br/>
			If erreth not in this my memory,</p>
			<p>As meditating then I seemed to have;<br/>
			Nor out of haste to question did I dare,<br/>
			Nor of myself I there could aught perceive;</p>
			<p>So I went onward timorous and thoughtful.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">The natural thirst, that ne'er is satisfied<br/>
			Excepting with the water for whose grace<br/>
			The woman of Samaria besought,</p>
			<p>Put me in travail, and haste goaded me<br/>

			And I was pitying that righteous vengeance;</p>
			<p>And lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth<br/>
			That Christ appeared to two upon the way<br/>
			From the sepulchral cave already risen,</p>
			<p>A shade appeared to us, and came behind us,<br/>
			Down gazing on the prostrate multitude,<br/>
			Nor were we ware of it, until it spake,</p>
			<p>Saying, "My brothers, may God give you peace!"<br/>
			We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered<br/>
			To him the countersign thereto conforming.</p>
			<p>Thereon began he: "In the blessed council,<br/>
			Thee may the court veracious place in peace,<br/>
			That me doth banish in eternal exile!"</p>
			<p>"How," said he, and the while we went with speed,<br/>
			"If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,<br/>
			Who up his stairs so far has guided you?"</p>
			<p>And said my Teacher: "If thou note the marks<br/>
			Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces<br/>
			Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.</p>
			<p>But because she who spinneth day and night<br/>
			For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,<br/>
			Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,</p>
			<p>His soul, which is thy sister and my own,<br/>
			In coming upwards could not come alone,<br/>
			By reason that it sees not in our fashion.</p>
			<p>Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat<br/>
			Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him<br/>
			As far on as my school has power to lead.</p>
			<p>But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder<br/>
			Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together<br/>
			All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?"</p>
			<p>In asking he so hit the very eye<br/>
			Of my desire, that merely with the hope<br/>
			My thirst became the less unsatisfied.</p>
			<p>"Naught is there," he began, "that without order<br/>
			May the religion of the mountain feel,<br/>
			Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom.</p>
			<p>Free is it here from every permutation;<br/>
			What from itself heaven in itself receiveth<br/>
			Can be of this the cause, and naught beside;</p>
			<p>Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,<br/>
			Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls<br/>
			Than the short, little stairway of three steps.</p>
			<p>Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,<br/>
			Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,<br/>
			That often upon earth her region shifts;</p>
			<p>No arid vapour any farther rises<br/>
			Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,<br/>
			Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet.</p>
			<p>Lower down perchance it trembles less or more,<br/>
			But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden<br/>
			I know not how, up here it never trembled.</p>
			<p>It trembles here, whenever any soul<br/>
			Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves<br/>
			To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.</p>
			<p>Of purity the will alone gives proof,<br/>
			Which, being wholly free to change its convent,<br/>
			Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.</p>
			<p>First it wills well; but the desire permits not,<br/>
			Which divine justice with the self-same will<br/>
			There was to sin, upon the torment sets.</p>
			<p>And I, who have been lying in this pain<br/>
			Five hundred years and more, but just now felt<br/>
			A free volition for a better seat.</p>
			<p>Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious<br/>
			Spirits along the mountain rendering praise<br/>
			Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards."</p>
			<p>So said he to him; and since we enjoy<br/>
			As much in drinking as the thirst is great,<br/>
			I could not say how much it did me good.</p>
			<p>And the wise Leader: "Now I see the net<br/>
			That snares you here, and how ye are set free,<br/>
			Why the earth quakes, and wherefore ye rejoice.</p>
			<p>Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know;<br/>
			And why so many centuries thou hast here<br/>
			Been lying, let me gather from thy words."</p>
			<p>"In days when the good Titus, with the aid<br/>
			Of the supremest King, avenged the wounds<br/>
			Whence issued forth the blood by Judas sold,</p>
			<p>Under the name that most endures and honours,<br/>
			Was I on earth," that spirit made reply,<br/>
			"Greatly renowned, but not with faith as yet.</p>
			<p>My vocal spirit was so sweet, that Rome<br/>
			Me, a Thoulousian, drew unto herself,<br/>
			Where I deserved to deck my brows with myrtle.</p>
			<p>Statius the people name me still on earth;<br/>
			I sang of Thebes, and then of great Achilles;<br/>
			But on the way fell with my second burden.</p>
			<p>The seeds unto my ardour were the sparks<br/>
			Of that celestial flame which heated me,<br/>
			Whereby more than a thousand have been fired;</p>
			<p>Of the Aeneid speak I, which to me<br/>
			A mother was, and was my nurse in song;<br/>
			Without this weighed I not a drachma's weight.</p>
			<p>And to have lived upon the earth what time<br/>
			Virgilius lived, I would accept one sun<br/>
			More than I must ere issuing from my ban."</p>
			<p>These words towards me made Virgilius turn<br/>
			With looks that in their silence said, "Be silent!"<br/>
			But yet the power that wills cannot do all things;</p>
			<p>For tears and laughter are such pursuivants<br/>
			Unto the passion from which each springs forth,<br/>
			In the most truthful least the will they follow.</p>
			<p>I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;<br/>
			Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed<br/>
			Into mine eyes, where most expression dwells;</p>
			<p>And, "As thou well mayst consummate a labour<br/>
			So great," it said, "why did thy face just now<br/>
			Display to me the lightning of a smile?"</p>
			<p>Now am I caught on this side and on that;<br/>
			One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me,<br/>
			Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood.</p>
			<p>"Speak," said my Master, "and be not afraid<br/>
			Of speaking, but speak out, and say to him<br/>
			What he demands with such solicitude."</p>
			<p>Whence I: "Thou peradventure marvellest,<br/>
			O antique spirit, at the smile I gave;<br/>
			But I will have more wonder seize upon thee.</p>
			<p>This one, who guides on high these eyes of mine,<br/>
			Is that Virgilius, from whom thou didst learn<br/>
			To sing aloud of men and of the Gods.</p>
			<p>If other cause thou to my smile imputedst,<br/>
			Abandon it as false, and trust it was<br/>
			Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him."</p>
			<p>Already he was stooping to embrace<br/>
			My Teacher's feet; but he said to him: "Brother,<br/>
			Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest."</p>
			<p>And he uprising: "Now canst thou the sum<br/>
			Of love which warms me to thee comprehend,<br/>
			When this our vanity I disremember,</p>
			<p>Treating a shadow as substantial thing."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Already was the Angel left behind us,<br/>
			The Angel who to the sixth round had turned us,<br/>
			Having erased one mark from off my face;</p>
			<p>And those who have in justice their desire<br/>
			Had said to us, "Beati," in their voices,<br/>
			With "sitio," and without more ended it.</p>
			<p>And I, more light than through the other passes,<br/>
			Went onward so, that without any labour<br/>
			I followed upward the swift-footed spirits;</p>
			<p>When thus Virgilius began: "The love<br/>
			Kindled by virtue aye another kindles,<br/>
			Provided outwardly its flame appear.</p>
			<p>Hence from the hour that Juvenal descended<br/>
			Among us into the infernal Limbo,<br/>
			Who made apparent to me thy affection,</p>
			<p>My kindliness towards thee was as great<br/>
			As ever bound one to an unseen person,<br/>
			So that these stairs will now seem short to me.</p>
			<p>But tell me, and forgive me as a friend,<br/>
			If too great confidence let loose the rein,<br/>
			And as a friend now hold discourse with me;</p>
			<p>How was it possible within thy breast<br/>
			For avarice to find place, 'mid so much wisdom<br/>
			As thou wast filled with by thy diligence?"</p>
			<p>These words excited Statius at first<br/>
			Somewhat to laughter; afterward he answered:<br/>
			"Each word of thine is love's dear sign to me.</p>
			<p>Verily oftentimes do things appear<br/>
			Which give fallacious matter to our doubts,<br/>
			Instead of the true causes which are hidden!</p>
			<p>Thy question shows me thy belief to be<br/>
			That I was niggard in the other life,<br/>
			It may be from the circle where I was;</p>
			<p>Therefore know thou, that avarice was removed<br/>
			Too far from me; and this extravagance<br/>
			Thousands of lunar periods have punished.</p>
			<p>And were it not that I my thoughts uplifted,<br/>
			When I the passage heard where thou exclaimest,<br/>
			As if indignant, unto human nature,</p>
			<p>'To what impellest thou not, O cursed hunger<br/>
			Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?'<br/>
			Revolving I should feel the dismal joustings.</p>
			<p>Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide<br/>
			Their wings in spending, and repented me<br/>
			As well of that as of my other sins;</p>
			<p>How many with shorn hair shall rise again<br/>
			Because of ignorance, which from this sin<br/>
			Cuts off repentance living and in death!</p>
			<p>And know that the transgression which rebuts<br/>
			By direct opposition any sin<br/>
			Together with it here its verdure dries.</p>
			<p>Therefore if I have been among that folk<br/>
			Which mourns its avarice, to purify me,<br/>
			For its opposite has this befallen me."</p>
			<p>"Now when thou sangest the relentless weapons<br/>
			Of the twofold affliction of Jocasta,"<br/>
			The singer of the Songs Bucolic said,</p>
			<p>"From that which Clio there with thee preludes,<br/>
			It does not seem that yet had made thee faithful<br/>
			That faith without which no good works suffice.</p>
			<p>If this be so, what candles or what sun<br/>
			Scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim<br/>
			Thy sails behind the Fisherman thereafter?"</p>
			<p>And he to him: "Thou first directedst me<br/>
			Towards Parnassus, in its grots to drink,<br/>
			And first concerning God didst me enlighten.</p>
			<p>Thou didst as he who walketh in the night,<br/>
			Who bears his light behind, which helps him not,<br/>
			But wary makes the persons after him,</p>
			<p>When thou didst say: 'The age renews itself,<br/>
			Justice returns, and man's primeval time,<br/>
			And a new progeny descends from heaven.'</p>
			<p>Through thee I Poet was, through thee a Christian;<br/>
			But that thou better see what I design,<br/>
			To colour it will I extend my hand.</p>
			<p>Already was the world in every part<br/>
			Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated<br/>
			By messengers of the eternal kingdom;</p>
			<p>And thy assertion, spoken of above,<br/>
			With the new preachers was in unison;<br/>
			Whence I to visit them the custom took.</p>
			<p>Then they became so holy in my sight,<br/>
			That, when Domitian persecuted them,<br/>
			Not without tears of mine were their laments;</p>
			<p>And all the while that I on earth remained,<br/>
			Them I befriended, and their upright customs<br/>
			Made me disparage all the other sects.</p>
			<p>And ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers<br/>
			Of Thebes, in poetry, I was baptized,<br/>
			But out of fear was covertly a Christian,</p>
			<p>For a long time professing paganism;<br/>
			And this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle<br/>
			To circuit round more than four centuries.</p>
			<p>Thou, therefore, who hast raised the covering<br/>
			That hid from me whatever good I speak of,<br/>
			While in ascending we have time to spare,</p>
			<p>Tell me, in what place is our friend Terentius,<br/>
			Caecilius, Plautus, Varro, if thou knowest;<br/>
			Tell me if they are damned, and in what alley."</p>
			<p>"These, Persius and myself, and others many,"<br/>
			Replied my Leader, "with that Grecian are<br/>
			Whom more than all the rest the Muses suckled,</p>
			<p>In the first circle of the prison blind;<br/>
			Ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse<br/>
			Which has our nurses ever with itself.</p>
			<p>Euripides is with us, Antiphon,<br/>
			Simonides, Agatho, and many other<br/>
			Greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked.</p>
			<p>There some of thine own people may be seen,<br/>
			Antigone, Deiphile and Argia,<br/>
			And there Ismene mournful as of old.</p>
			<p>There she is seen who pointed out Langia;<br/>
			There is Tiresias' daughter, and there Thetis,<br/>
			And there Deidamia with her sisters."</p>
			<p>Silent already were the poets both,<br/>
			Attent once more in looking round about,<br/>
			From the ascent and from the walls released;</p>
			<p>And four handmaidens of the day already<br/>
			Were left behind, and at the pole the fifth<br/>
			Was pointing upward still its burning horn,</p>
			<p>What time my Guide: "I think that tow'rds the edge<br/>
			Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn,<br/>
			Circling the mount as we are wont to do."</p>
			<p>Thus in that region custom was our ensign;<br/>
			And we resumed our way with less suspicion<br/>
			For the assenting of that worthy soul</p>
			<p>They in advance went on, and I alone<br/>
			Behind them, and I listened to their speech,<br/>
			Which gave me lessons in the art of song.</p>
			<p>But soon their sweet discourses interrupted<br/>
			A tree which midway in the road we found,<br/>
			With apples sweet and grateful to the smell.</p>
			<p>And even as a fir-tree tapers upward<br/>
			From bough to bough, so downwardly did that;<br/>
			I think in order that no one might climb it.</p>
			<p>On that side where our pathway was enclosed<br/>
			Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water,<br/>
			And spread itself abroad upon the leaves.</p>
			<p>The Poets twain unto the tree drew near,<br/>
			And from among the foliage a voice<br/>
			Cried: "Of this food ye shall have scarcity."</p>
			<p>Then said: "More thoughtful Mary was of making<br/>
			The marriage feast complete and honourable,<br/>
			Than of her mouth which now for you responds;</p>
			<p>And for their drink the ancient Roman women<br/>
			With water were content; and Daniel<br/>
			Disparaged food, and understanding won.</p>
			<p>The primal age was beautiful as gold;<br/>
			Acorns it made with hunger savorous,<br/>
			And nectar every rivulet with thirst.</p>
			<p>Honey and locusts were the aliments<br/>
			That fed the Baptist in the wilderness;<br/>
			Whence he is glorious, and so magnified</p>
			<p>As by the Evangel is revealed to you."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">The while among the verdant leaves mine eyes<br/>
			I riveted, as he is wont to do<br/>
			Who wastes his life pursuing little birds,</p>
			<p>My more than Father said unto me: "Son,<br/>
			Come now; because the time that is ordained us<br/>
			More usefully should be apportioned out."</p>
			<p>I turned my face and no less soon my steps<br/>
			Unto the Sages, who were speaking so<br/>
			They made the going of no cost to me;</p>
			<p>And lo! were heard a song and a lament,<br/>
			"Labia mea, Domine," in fashion<br/>
			Such that delight and dolence it brought forth.</p>
			<p>"O my sweet Father, what is this I hear?"<br/>
			Began I; and he answered: "Shades that go<br/>
			Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt."</p>
			<p>In the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do,<br/>
			Who, unknown people on the road o'ertaking,<br/>
			Turn themselves round to them, and do not stop,</p>
			<p>Even thus, behind us with a swifter motion<br/>
			Coming and passing onward, gazed upon us<br/>
			A crowd of spirits silent and devout.</p>
			<p>Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous,<br/>
			Pallid in face, and so emaciate<br/>
			That from the bones the skin did shape itself.</p>
			<p>I do not think that so to merest rind<br/>
			Could Erisichthon have been withered up<br/>
			By famine, when most fear he had of it.</p>
			<p>Thinking within myself I said: "Behold,<br/>
			This is the folk who lost Jerusalem,<br/>
			When Mary made a prey of her own son."</p>
			<p>Their sockets were like rings without the gems;<br/>
			Whoever in the face of men reads 'omo'<br/>
			Might well in these have recognised the 'm.'</p>
			<p>Who would believe the odour of an apple,<br/>
			Begetting longing, could consume them so,<br/>
			And that of water, without knowing how?</p>
			<p>I still was wondering what so famished them,<br/>
			For the occasion not yet manifest<br/>
			Of their emaciation and sad squalor;</p>
			<p>And lo! from out the hollow of his head<br/>
			His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;<br/>
			Then cried aloud: "What grace to me is this?"</p>
			<p>Never should I have known him by his look;<br/>
			But in his voice was evident to me<br/>
			That which his aspect had suppressed within it.</p>
			<p>This spark within me wholly re-enkindled<br/>
			My recognition of his altered face,<br/>
			And I recalled the features of Forese.</p>
			<p>"Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,"<br/>
			Entreated he, "which doth my skin discolour,<br/>
			Nor at default of flesh that I may have;</p>
			<p>But tell me truth of thee, and who are those<br/>
			Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort;<br/>
			Do not delay in speaking unto me."</p>
			<p>"That face of thine, which dead I once bewept,<br/>
			Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief,"<br/>
			I answered him, "beholding it so changed!</p>
			<p>But tell me, for God's sake, what thus denudes you?<br/>
			Make me not speak while I am marvelling,<br/>
			For ill speaks he who's full of other longings."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "From the eternal council<br/>
			Falls power into the water and the tree<br/>
			Behind us left, whereby I grow so thin.</p>
			<p>All of this people who lamenting sing,<br/>
			For following beyond measure appetite<br/>
			In hunger and thirst are here re-sanctified.</p>
			<p>Desire to eat and drink enkindles in us<br/>
			The scent that issues from the apple-tree,<br/>
			And from the spray that sprinkles o'er the verdure;</p>
			<p>And not a single time alone, this ground<br/>
			Encompassing, is refreshed our pain,—<br/>
			I say our pain, and ought to say our solace,—</p>
			<p>For the same wish doth lead us to the tree<br/>
			Which led the Christ rejoicing to say 'Eli,'<br/>
			When with his veins he liberated us."</p>
			<p>And I to him: "Forese, from that day<br/>
			When for a better life thou changedst worlds,<br/>
			Up to this time five years have not rolled round.</p>
			<p>If sooner were the power exhausted in thee<br/>
			Of sinning more, than thee the hour surprised<br/>
			Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us,</p>
			<p>How hast thou come up hitherward already?<br/>
			I thought to find thee down there underneath,<br/>
			Where time for time doth restitution make."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Thus speedily has led me<br/>
			To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments,<br/>
			My Nella with her overflowing tears;</p>
			<p>She with her prayers devout and with her sighs<br/>
			Has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits,<br/>
			And from the other circles set me free.</p>
			<p>So much more dear and pleasing is to God<br/>
			My little widow, whom so much I loved,<br/>
			As in good works she is the more alone;</p>
			<p>For the Barbagia of Sardinia<br/>
			By far more modest in its women is<br/>
			Than the Barbagia I have left her in.</p>
			<p>O brother sweet, what wilt thou have me say?<br/>
			A future time is in my sight already,<br/>
			To which this hour will not be very old,</p>
			<p>When from the pulpit shall be interdicted<br/>
			To the unblushing womankind of Florence<br/>
			To go about displaying breast and paps.</p>
			<p>What savages were e'er, what Saracens,<br/>
			Who stood in need, to make them covered go,<br/>
			Of spiritual or other discipline?</p>
			<p>But if the shameless women were assured<br/>
			Of what swift Heaven prepares for them, already<br/>
			Wide open would they have their mouths to howl;</p>
			<p>For if my foresight here deceive me not,<br/>
			They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks<br/>
			Who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby.</p>
			<p>O brother, now no longer hide thee from me;<br/>
			See that not only I, but all these people<br/>
			Are gazing there, where thou dost veil the sun."</p>
			<p>Whence I to him: "If thou bring back to mind<br/>
			What thou with me hast been and I with thee,<br/>
			The present memory will be grievous still.</p>
			<p>Out of that life he turned me back who goes<br/>
			In front of me, two days agone when round<br/>
			The sister of him yonder showed herself,"</p>
			<p>And to the sun I pointed.  "Through the deep<br/>
			Night of the truly dead has this one led me,<br/>
			With this true flesh, that follows after him.</p>
			<p>Thence his encouragements have led me up,<br/>
			Ascending and still circling round the mount<br/>
			That you doth straighten, whom the world made crooked.</p>
			<p>He says that he will bear me company,<br/>
			Till I shall be where Beatrice will be;<br/>
			There it behoves me to remain without him.</p>
			<p>This is Virgilius, who thus says to me,"<br/>
			And him I pointed at; "the other is<br/>
			That shade for whom just now shook every slope</p>
			<p>Your realm, that from itself discharges him."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXIV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Nor speech the going, nor the going that<br/>
			Slackened; but talking we went bravely on,<br/>
			Even as a vessel urged by a good wind.</p>
			<p>And shadows, that appeared things doubly dead,<br/>
			From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed<br/>
			Wonder at me, aware that I was living.</p>
			<p>And I, continuing my colloquy,<br/>
			Said: "Peradventure he goes up more slowly<br/>
			Than he would do, for other people's sake.</p>
			<p>But tell me, if thou knowest, where is Piccarda;<br/>
			Tell me if any one of note I see<br/>
			Among this folk that gazes at me so."</p>
			<p>"My sister, who, 'twixt beautiful and good,<br/>
			I know not which was more, triumphs rejoicing<br/>
			Already in her crown on high Olympus."</p>
			<p>So said he first, and then: "'Tis not forbidden<br/>
			To name each other here, so milked away<br/>
			Is our resemblance by our dieting.</p>
			<p>This," pointing with his finger, "is Buonagiunta,<br/>
			Buonagiunta, of Lucca; and that face<br/>

			<p>Has held the holy Church within his arms;<br/>
			From Tours was he, and purges by his fasting<br/>
			Bolsena's eels and the Vernaccia wine."</p>
			<p>He named me many others one by one;<br/>
			And all contented seemed at being named,<br/>
			So that for this I saw not one dark look.</p>
			<p>I saw for hunger bite the empty air<br/>
			Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,<br/>
			Who with his crook had pastured many people.</p>
			<p>I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure<br/>
			Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,<br/>
			And he was one who ne'er felt satisfied.</p>
			<p>But as he does who scans, and then doth prize<br/>
			One more than others, did I him of Lucca,<br/>
			Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.</p>
			<p>He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca<br/>
			From that place heard I, where he felt the wound<br/>
			Of justice, that doth macerate them so.</p>
			<p>"O soul," I said, "that seemest so desirous<br/>
			To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,<br/>
			And with thy speech appease thyself and me."</p>
			<p>"A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,"<br/>
			Began he, "who to thee shall pleasant make<br/>
			My city, howsoever men may blame it.</p>
			<p>Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;<br/>
			If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,<br/>
			True things hereafter will declare it to thee.</p>
			<p>But say if him I here behold, who forth<br/>
			Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,<br/>
			'Ladies, that have intelligence of love?'"</p>
			<p>And I to him: "One am I, who, whenever<br/>
			Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure<br/>
			Which he within me dictates, singing go."</p>
			<p>"O brother, now I see," he said, "the knot<br/>
			Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held<br/>
			Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.</p>
			<p>I do perceive full clearly how your pens<br/>
			Go closely following after him who dictates,<br/>
			Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;</p>
			<p>And he who sets himself to go beyond,<br/>
			No difference sees from one style to another;"<br/>
			And as if satisfied, he held his peace.</p>
			<p>Even as the birds, that winter tow'rds the Nile,<br/>
			Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,<br/>
			Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;</p>
			<p>In such wise all the people who were there,<br/>
			Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,<br/>
			Both by their leanness and their wishes light.</p>
			<p>And as a man, who weary is with trotting,<br/>
			Lets his companions onward go, and walks,<br/>
			Until he vents the panting of his chest;</p>
			<p>So did Forese let the holy flock<br/>
			Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,<br/>
			"When will it be that I again shall see thee?"</p>
			<p>"How long," I answered, "I may live, I know not;<br/>
			Yet my return will not so speedy be,<br/>
			But I shall sooner in desire arrive;</p>
			<p>Because the place where I was set to live<br/>
			From day to day of good is more depleted,<br/>
			And unto dismal ruin seems ordained."</p>
			<p>"Now go," he said, "for him most guilty of it<br/>
			At a beast's tail behold I dragged along<br/>
			Towards the valley where is no repentance.</p>
			<p>Faster at every step the beast is going,<br/>
			Increasing evermore until it smites him,<br/>
			And leaves the body vilely mutilated.</p>
			<p>Not long those wheels shall turn," and he uplifted<br/>
			His eyes to heaven, "ere shall be clear to thee<br/>
			That which my speech no farther can declare.</p>
			<p>Now stay behind; because the time so precious<br/>
			Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much<br/>
			By coming onward thus abreast with thee."</p>
			<p>As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop<br/>
			A cavalier from out a troop that ride,<br/>
			And seeks the honour of the first encounter,</p>
			<p>So he with greater strides departed from us;<br/>
			And on the road remained I with those two,<br/>
			Who were such mighty marshals of the world.</p>
			<p>And when before us he had gone so far<br/>
			Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants<br/>
			As was my understanding to his words,</p>
			<p>Appeared to me with laden and living boughs<br/>
			Another apple-tree, and not far distant,<br/>
			From having but just then turned thitherward.</p>
			<p>People I saw beneath it lift their hands,<br/>
			And cry I know not what towards the leaves,<br/>
			Like little children eager and deluded,</p>
			<p>Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,<br/>
			But, to make very keen their appetite,<br/>
			Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.</p>
			<p>Then they departed as if undeceived;<br/>
			And now we came unto the mighty tree<br/>
			Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.</p>
			<p>"Pass farther onward without drawing near;<br/>
			The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,<br/>
			And out of that one has this tree been raised."</p>
			<p>Thus said I know not who among the branches;<br/>
			Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself<br/>
			Went crowding forward on the side that rises.</p>
			<p>"Be mindful," said he, "of the accursed ones<br/>
			Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate<br/>
			Combated Theseus with their double breasts;</p>
			<p>And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,<br/>
			Whence Gideon would not have them for companions<br/>
			When he tow'rds Midian the hills descended."</p>
			<p>Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,<br/>
			On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,<br/>
			Followed forsooth by miserable gains;</p>
			<p>Then set at large upon the lonely road,<br/>
			A thousand steps and more we onward went,<br/>
			In contemplation, each without a word.</p>
			<p>"What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?"<br/>
			Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started<br/>
			As terrified and timid beasts are wont.</p>
			<p>I raised my head to see who this might be,<br/>
			And never in a furnace was there seen<br/>
			Metals or glass so lucent and so red</p>
			<p>As one I saw who said: "If it may please you<br/>
			To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;<br/>
			This way goes he who goeth after peace."</p>
			<p>His aspect had bereft me of my sight,<br/>
			So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,<br/>
			Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.</p>
			<p>And as, the harbinger of early dawn,<br/>
			The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,<br/>
			Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,</p>
			<p>So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst<br/>
			My front, and felt the moving of the plumes<br/>
			That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;</p>
			<p>And heard it said: "Blessed are they whom grace<br/>
			So much illumines, that the love of taste<br/>
			Excites not in their breasts too great desire,</p>
			<p>Hungering at all times so far as is just."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked,<br/>

			To Taurus left, and night to Scorpio;</p>
			<p>Wherefore as doth a man who tarries not,<br/>

			If of necessity the sting transfix him,</p>
			<p>In this wise did we enter through the gap,<br/>
			Taking the stairway, one before the other,<br/>

			<p>And as the little stork that lifts its wing<br/>

			<p>Not for our pace, though rapid it might be,<br/>

			<p>With confidence I opened then my mouth,<br/>

			<p>"If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance,"<br/>
			Responded Statius, "where thou present art,<br/>
			Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee."</p>
			<p>Then he began: "Son, if these words of mine<br/>

			<p>There one together with the other mingles,<br/>
			One to be passive meant, the other active<br/>
			By reason of the perfect place it springs from;</p>
			<p>And being conjoined, begins to operate,<br/>
			Coagulating first, then vivifying<br/>
			What for its matter it had made consistent.</p>
			<p>The active virtue, being made a soul<br/>
			As of a plant, (in so far different,<br/>
			This on the way is, that arrived already,)</p>
			<p>Then works so much, that now it moves and feels<br/>
			Like a sea-fungus, and then undertakes<br/>
			To organize the powers whose seed it is.</p>
			<p>Now, Son, dilates and now distends itself<br/>
			The virtue from the generator's heart,<br/>
			Where nature is intent on all the members.</p>
			<p>But how from animal it man becomes<br/>
			Thou dost not see as yet; this is a point<br/>
			Which made a wiser man than thou once err</p>
			<p>So far, that in his doctrine separate<br/>
			He made the soul from possible intellect,<br/>
			For he no organ saw by this assumed.</p>
			<p>Open thy breast unto the truth that's coming,<br/>
			And know that, just as soon as in the foetus<br/>
			The articulation of the brain is perfect,</p>
			<p>The primal Motor turns to it well pleased<br/>
			At so great art of nature, and inspires<br/>
			A spirit new with virtue all replete,</p>
			<p>Which what it finds there active doth attract<br/>
			Into its substance, and becomes one soul,<br/>
			Which lives, and feels, and on itself revolves.</p>
			<p>And that thou less may wonder at my word,<br/>
			Behold the sun's heat, which becometh wine,<br/>
			Joined to the juice that from the vine distils.</p>
			<p>Whenever Lachesis has no more thread,<br/>
			It separates from the flesh, and virtually<br/>
			Bears with itself the human and divine;</p>
			<p>The other faculties are voiceless all;<br/>
			The memory, the intelligence, and the will<br/>
			In action far more vigorous than before.</p>
			<p>Without a pause it falleth of itself<br/>
			In marvellous way on one shore or the other;<br/>
			There of its roads it first is cognizant.</p>
			<p>Soon as the place there circumscribeth it,<br/>
			The virtue informative rays round about,<br/>
			As, and as much as, in the living members.</p>
			<p>And even as the air, when full of rain,<br/>
			By alien rays that are therein reflected,<br/>
			With divers colours shows itself adorned,</p>
			<p>So there the neighbouring air doth shape itself<br/>
			Into that form which doth impress upon it<br/>
			Virtually the soul that has stood still.</p>
			<p>And then in manner of the little flame,<br/>
			Which followeth the fire where'er it shifts,<br/>
			After the spirit followeth its new form.</p>
			<p>Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance,<br/>
			It is called shade; and thence it organizes<br/>
			Thereafter every sense, even to the sight.</p>
			<p>Thence is it that we speak, and thence we laugh;<br/>
			Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs,<br/>
			That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard.</p>
			<p>According as impress us our desires<br/>
			And other affections, so the shade is shaped,<br/>
			And this is cause of what thou wonderest at."</p>
			<p>And now unto the last of all the circles<br/>
			Had we arrived, and to the right hand turned,<br/>
			And were attentive to another care.</p>
			<p>There the embankment shoots forth flames of fire,<br/>
			And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast<br/>
			That drives them back, and from itself sequesters.</p>
			<p>Hence we must needs go on the open side,<br/>
			And one by one; and I did fear the fire<br/>
			On this side, and on that the falling down.</p>
			<p>My Leader said: "Along this place one ought<br/>
			To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein,<br/>
			Seeing that one so easily might err."</p>
			<p>"Summae Deus clementiae," in the bosom<br/>
			Of the great burning chanted then I heard,<br/>
			Which made me no less eager to turn round;</p>
			<p>And spirits saw I walking through the flame;<br/>
			Wherefore I looked, to my own steps and theirs<br/>
			Apportioning my sight from time to time.</p>
			<p>After the close which to that hymn is made,<br/>
			Aloud they shouted, "Virum non cognosco;"<br/>
			Then recommenced the hymn with voices low.</p>
			<p>This also ended, cried they: "To the wood<br/>
			Diana ran, and drove forth Helice<br/>
			Therefrom, who had of Venus felt the poison."</p>
			<p>Then to their song returned they; then the wives<br/>
			They shouted, and the husbands who were chaste.<br/>
			As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.</p>
			<p>And I believe that them this mode suffices,<br/>
			For all the time the fire is burning them;<br/>
			With such care is it needful, and such food,</p>
			<p>That the last wound of all should be closed up.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXVI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">While on the brink thus one before the other<br/>
			We went upon our way, oft the good Master<br/>
			Said: "Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee."</p>
			<p>On the right shoulder smote me now the sun,<br/>
			That, raying out, already the whole west<br/>
			Changed from its azure aspect into white.</p>
			<p>And with my shadow did I make the flame<br/>
			Appear more red; and even to such a sign<br/>
			Shades saw I many, as they went, give heed.</p>
			<p>This was the cause that gave them a beginning<br/>
			To speak of me; and to themselves began they<br/>
			To say: "That seems not a factitious body!"</p>
			<p>Then towards me, as far as they could come,<br/>
			Came certain of them, always with regard<br/>
			Not to step forth where they would not be burned.</p>
			<p>"O thou who goest, not from being slower<br/>
			But reverent perhaps, behind the others,<br/>
			Answer me, who in thirst and fire am burning.</p>
			<p>Nor to me only is thine answer needful;<br/>
			For all of these have greater thirst for it<br/>
			Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian.</p>
			<p>Tell us how is it that thou makest thyself<br/>
			A wall unto the sun, as if thou hadst not<br/>
			Entered as yet into the net of death."</p>
			<p>Thus one of them addressed me, and I straight<br/>
			Should have revealed myself, were I not bent<br/>
			On other novelty that then appeared.</p>
			<p>For through the middle of the burning road<br/>
			There came a people face to face with these,<br/>
			Which held me in suspense with gazing at them.</p>
			<p>There see I hastening upon either side<br/>
			Each of the shades, and kissing one another<br/>
			Without a pause, content with brief salute.</p>
			<p>Thus in the middle of their brown battalions<br/>
			Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another<br/>
			Perchance to spy their journey or their fortune.</p>
			<p>No sooner is the friendly greeting ended,<br/>
			Or ever the first footstep passes onward,<br/>
			Each one endeavours to outcry the other;</p>
			<p>The new-come people: "Sodom and Gomorrah!"<br/>
			The rest: "Into the cow Pasiphae enters,<br/>
			So that the bull unto her lust may run!"</p>
			<p>Then as the cranes, that to Riphaean mountains<br/>
			Might fly in part, and part towards the sands,<br/>
			These of the frost, those of the sun avoidant,</p>
			<p>One folk is going, and the other coming,<br/>
			And weeping they return to their first songs,<br/>
			And to the cry that most befitteth them;</p>
			<p>And close to me approached, even as before,<br/>
			The very same who had entreated me,<br/>
			Attent to listen in their countenance.</p>
			<p>I, who their inclination twice had seen,<br/>
			Began: "O souls secure in the possession,<br/>
			Whene'er it may be, of a state of peace,</p>
			<p>Neither unripe nor ripened have remained<br/>
			My members upon earth, but here are with me<br/>
			With their own blood and their articulations.</p>
			<p>I go up here to be no longer blind;<br/>
			A Lady is above, who wins this grace,<br/>
			Whereby the mortal through your world I bring.</p>
			<p>But as your greatest longing satisfied<br/>
			May soon become, so that the Heaven may house you<br/>
			Which full of love is, and most amply spreads,</p>
			<p>Tell me, that I again in books may write it,<br/>
			Who are you, and what is that multitude<br/>
			Which goes upon its way behind your backs?"</p>
			<p>Not otherwise with wonder is bewildered<br/>
			The mountaineer, and staring round is dumb,<br/>
			When rough and rustic to the town he goes,</p>
			<p>Than every shade became in its appearance;<br/>
			But when they of their stupor were disburdened,<br/>
			Which in high hearts is quickly quieted,</p>
			<p>"Blessed be thou, who of our border-lands,"<br/>
			He recommenced who first had questioned us,<br/>
			"Experience freightest for a better life.</p>
			<p>The folk that comes not with us have offended<br/>
			In that for which once Caesar, triumphing,<br/>
			Heard himself called in contumely, 'Queen.'</p>
			<p>Therefore they separate, exclaiming, 'Sodom!'<br/>
			Themselves reproving, even as thou hast heard,<br/>
			And add unto their burning by their shame.</p>
			<p>Our own transgression was hermaphrodite;<br/>
			But because we observed not human law,<br/>
			Following like unto beasts our appetite,</p>
			<p>In our opprobrium by us is read,<br/>
			When we part company, the name of her<br/>
			Who bestialized herself in bestial wood.</p>
			<p>Now knowest thou our acts, and what our crime was;<br/>
			Wouldst thou perchance by name know who we are,<br/>
			There is not time to tell, nor could I do it.</p>
			<p>Thy wish to know me shall in sooth be granted;<br/>
			I'm Guido Guinicelli, and now purge me,<br/>
			Having repented ere the hour extreme."</p>
			<p>The same that in the sadness of Lycurgus<br/>
			Two sons became, their mother re-beholding,<br/>
			Such I became, but rise not to such height,</p>
			<p>The moment I heard name himself the father<br/>
			Of me and of my betters, who had ever<br/>
			Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love;</p>
			<p>And without speech and hearing thoughtfully<br/>
			For a long time I went, beholding him,<br/>
			Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer.</p>
			<p>When I was fed with looking, utterly<br/>
			Myself I offered ready for his service,<br/>
			With affirmation that compels belief.</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Thou leavest footprints such<br/>
			In me, from what I hear, and so distinct,<br/>
			Lethe cannot efface them, nor make dim.</p>
			<p>But if thy words just now the truth have sworn,<br/>
			Tell me what is the cause why thou displayest<br/>
			In word and look that dear thou holdest me?"</p>
			<p>And I to him: "Those dulcet lays of yours<br/>
			Which, long as shall endure our modern fashion,<br/>
			Shall make for ever dear their very ink!"</p>
			<p>"O brother," said he, "he whom I point out,"<br/>
			And here he pointed at a spirit in front,<br/>
			"Was of the mother tongue a better smith.</p>
			<p>Verses of love and proses of romance,<br/>
			He mastered all; and let the idiots talk,<br/>
			Who think the Lemosin surpasses him.</p>
			<p>To clamour more than truth they turn their faces,<br/>
			And in this way establish their opinion,<br/>
			Ere art or reason has by them been heard.</p>
			<p>Thus many ancients with Guittone did,<br/>
			From cry to cry still giving him applause,<br/>
			Until the truth has conquered with most persons.</p>
			<p>Now, if thou hast such ample privilege<br/>
			'Tis granted thee to go unto the cloister<br/>
			Wherein is Christ the abbot of the college,</p>
			<p>To him repeat for me a Paternoster,<br/>
			So far as needful to us of this world,<br/>
			Where power of sinning is no longer ours."</p>
			<p>Then, to give place perchance to one behind,<br/>
			Whom he had near, he vanished in the fire<br/>
			As fish in water going to the bottom.</p>
			<p>I moved a little tow'rds him pointed out,<br/>
			And said that to his name my own desire<br/>
			An honourable place was making ready.</p>
			<p>He of his own free will began to say:<br/>
			'Tan m' abellis vostre cortes deman,<br/>
			Que jeu nom' puesc ni vueill a vos cobrire;</p>
			<p>Jeu sui Arnaut, que plor e vai chantan;<br/>
			Consiros vei la passada folor,<br/>
			E vei jauzen lo jorn qu' esper denan.</p>
			<p>Ara vus prec per aquella valor,<br/>
			Que vus condus al som de la scalina,<br/>
			Sovenga vus a temprar ma dolor.'*</p>
			<p>Then hid him in the fire that purifies them.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">* So pleases me your courteous demand,<br/>
			I cannot and I will not hide me from you.<br/>
			I am Arnaut, who weep and singing go;<br/>
			Contrite I see the folly of the past,<br/>
			And joyous see the hoped-for day before me.<br/>
			Therefore do I implore you, by that power<br/>
			Which guides you to the summit of the stairs,<br/>
			Be mindful to assuage my suffering!</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXVII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">As when he vibrates forth his earliest rays,<br/>
			In regions where his Maker shed his blood,<br/>
			(The Ebro falling under lofty Libra,</p>
			<p>And waters in the Ganges burnt with noon,)<br/>
			So stood the Sun; hence was the day departing,<br/>
			When the glad Angel of God appeared to us.</p>
			<p>Outside the flame he stood upon the verge,<br/>
			And chanted forth, "Beati mundo corde,"<br/>
			In voice by far more living than our own.</p>
			<p>Then: "No one farther goes, souls sanctified,<br/>
			If first the fire bite not; within it enter,<br/>
			And be not deaf unto the song beyond."</p>
			<p>When we were close beside him thus he said;<br/>
			Wherefore e'en such became I, when I heard him,<br/>
			As he is who is put into the grave.</p>
			<p>Upon my clasped hands I straightened me,<br/>
			Scanning the fire, and vividly recalling<br/>
			The human bodies I had once seen burned.</p>
			<p>Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors,<br/>
			And unto me Virgilius said: "My son,<br/>
			Here may indeed be torment, but not death.</p>
			<p>Remember thee, remember! and if I<br/>
			On Geryon have safely guided thee,<br/>
			What shall I do now I am nearer God?</p>
			<p>Believe for certain, shouldst thou stand a full<br/>
			Millennium in the bosom of this flame,<br/>
			It could not make thee bald a single hair.</p>
			<p>And if perchance thou think that I deceive thee,<br/>
			Draw near to it, and put it to the proof<br/>
			With thine own hands upon thy garment's hem.</p>
			<p>Now lay aside, now lay aside all fear,<br/>
			Turn hitherward, and onward come securely;"<br/>
			And I still motionless, and 'gainst my conscience!</p>
			<p>Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,<br/>
			Somewhat disturbed he said: "Now look thou, Son,<br/>
			'Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall."</p>
			<p>As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids<br/>
			The dying Pyramus, and gazed upon her,<br/>
			What time the mulberry became vermilion,</p>
			<p>Even thus, my obduracy being softened,<br/>
			I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name<br/>
			That in my memory evermore is welling.</p>
			<p>Whereat he wagged his head, and said: "How now?<br/>
			Shall we stay on this side?" then smiled as one<br/>
			Does at a child who's vanquished by an apple.</p>
			<p>Then into the fire in front of me he entered,<br/>
			Beseeching Statius to come after me,<br/>
			Who a long way before divided us.</p>
			<p>When I was in it, into molten glass<br/>
			I would have cast me to refresh myself,<br/>
			So without measure was the burning there!</p>
			<p>And my sweet Father, to encourage me,<br/>
			Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,<br/>
			Saying: "Her eyes I seem to see already!"</p>
			<p>A voice, that on the other side was singing,<br/>
			Directed us, and we, attent alone<br/>
			On that, came forth where the ascent began.</p>
			<p>"Venite, benedicti Patris mei,"<br/>
			Sounded within a splendour, which was there<br/>
			Such it o'ercame me, and I could not look.</p>
			<p>"The sun departs," it added, "and night cometh;<br/>
			Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps,<br/>
			So long as yet the west becomes not dark."</p>
			<p>Straight forward through the rock the path ascended<br/>
			In such a way that I cut off the rays<br/>
			Before me of the sun, that now was low.</p>
			<p>And of few stairs we yet had made assay,<br/>
			Ere by the vanished shadow the sun's setting<br/>
			Behind us we perceived, I and my Sages.</p>
			<p>And ere in all its parts immeasurable<br/>
			The horizon of one aspect had become,<br/>
			And Night her boundless dispensation held,</p>
			<p>Each of us of a stair had made his bed;<br/>
			Because the nature of the mount took from us<br/>
			The power of climbing, more than the delight.</p>
			<p>Even as in ruminating passive grow<br/>
			The goats, who have been swift and venturesome<br/>
			Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,</p>
			<p>Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,<br/>
			Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff<br/>
			Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;</p>
			<p>And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,<br/>
			Passes the night beside his quiet flock,<br/>
			Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,</p>
			<p>Such at that hour were we, all three of us,<br/>
			I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,<br/>
			Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.</p>
			<p>Little could there be seen of things without;<br/>
			But through that little I beheld the stars<br/>
			More luminous and larger than their wont.</p>
			<p>Thus ruminating, and beholding these,<br/>
			Sleep seized upon me,—sleep, that oftentimes<br/>
			Before a deed is done has tidings of it.</p>
			<p>It was the hour, I think, when from the East<br/>
			First on the mountain Citherea beamed,<br/>
			Who with the fire of love seems always burning;</p>
			<p>Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought<br/>
			I saw a lady walking in a meadow,<br/>
			Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:</p>
			<p>"Know whosoever may my name demand<br/>
			That I am Leah, and go moving round<br/>
			My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.</p>
			<p>To please me at the mirror, here I deck me,<br/>
			But never does my sister Rachel leave<br/>
			Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.</p>
			<p>To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,<br/>
			As I am to adorn me with my hands;<br/>
			Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies."</p>
			<p>And now before the antelucan splendours<br/>
			That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,<br/>
			As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,</p>
			<p>The darkness fled away on every side,<br/>
			And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,<br/>
			Seeing already the great Masters risen.</p>
			<p>"That apple sweet, which through so many branches<br/>
			The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,<br/>
			To-day shall put in peace thy hungerings."</p>
			<p>Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words<br/>
			As these made use; and never were there guerdons<br/>
			That could in pleasantness compare with these.</p>
			<p>Such longing upon longing came upon me<br/>
			To be above, that at each step thereafter<br/>
			For flight I felt in me the pinions growing.</p>
			<p>When underneath us was the stairway all<br/>
			Run o'er, and we were on the highest step,<br/>
			Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,</p>
			<p>And said: "The temporal fire and the eternal,<br/>
			Son, thou hast seen, and to a place art come<br/>
			Where of myself no farther I discern.</p>
			<p>By intellect and art I here have brought thee;<br/>
			Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth;<br/>
			Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou.</p>
			<p>Behold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead;<br/>
			Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs<br/>
			Which of itself alone this land produces.</p>
			<p>Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes<br/>
			Which weeping caused me to come unto thee,<br/>
			Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them.</p>
			<p>Expect no more or word or sign from me;<br/>
			Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,<br/>
			And error were it not to do its bidding;</p>
			<p>Thee o'er thyself I therefore crown and mitre!"</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXVIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Eager already to search in and round<br/>
			The heavenly forest, dense and living-green,<br/>
			Which tempered to the eyes the new-born day,</p>
			<p>Withouten more delay I left the bank,<br/>
			Taking the level country slowly, slowly<br/>
			Over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance.</p>
			<p>A softly-breathing air, that no mutation<br/>
			Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me<br/>
			No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,</p>
			<p>Whereat the branches, lightly tremulous,<br/>
			Did all of them bow downward toward that side<br/>
			Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mountain;</p>
			<p>Yet not from their upright direction swayed,<br/>
			So that the little birds upon their tops<br/>
			Should leave the practice of each art of theirs;</p>
			<p>But with full ravishment the hours of prime,<br/>
			Singing, received they in the midst of leaves,<br/>
			That ever bore a burden to their rhymes,</p>
			<p>Such as from branch to branch goes gathering on<br/>
			Through the pine forest on the shore of Chiassi,<br/>
			When Eolus unlooses the Sirocco.</p>
			<p>Already my slow steps had carried me<br/>
			Into the ancient wood so far, that I<br/>
			Could not perceive where I had entered it.</p>
			<p>And lo! my further course a stream cut off,<br/>
			Which tow'rd the left hand with its little waves<br/>
			Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang.</p>
			<p>All waters that on earth most limpid are<br/>
			Would seem to have within themselves some mixture<br/>
			Compared with that which nothing doth conceal,</p>
			<p>Although it moves on with a brown, brown current<br/>
			Under the shade perpetual, that never<br/>
			Ray of the sun lets in, nor of the moon.</p>
			<p>With feet I stayed, and with mine eyes I passed<br/>
			Beyond the rivulet, to look upon<br/>
			The great variety of the fresh may.</p>
			<p>And there appeared to me (even as appears<br/>
			Suddenly something that doth turn aside<br/>
			Through very wonder every other thought)</p>
			<p>A lady all alone, who went along<br/>
			Singing and culling floweret after floweret,<br/>
			With which her pathway was all painted over.</p>
			<p>"Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love<br/>
			Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,<br/>
			Which the heart's witnesses are wont to be,</p>
			<p>May the desire come unto thee to draw<br/>
			Near to this river's bank," I said to her,<br/>
			"So much that I might hear what thou art singing.</p>
			<p>Thou makest me remember where and what<br/>
			Proserpina that moment was when lost<br/>
			Her mother her, and she herself the Spring."</p>
			<p>As turns herself, with feet together pressed<br/>
			And to the ground, a lady who is dancing,<br/>
			And hardly puts one foot before the other,</p>
			<p>On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets<br/>
			She turned towards me, not in other wise<br/>
			Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down;</p>
			<p>And my entreaties made to be content,<br/>
			So near approaching, that the dulcet sound<br/>
			Came unto me together with its meaning</p>
			<p>As soon as she was where the grasses are.<br/>
			Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,<br/>
			To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.</p>
			<p>I do not think there shone so great a light<br/>
			Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed<br/>
			By her own son, beyond his usual custom!</p>
			<p>Erect upon the other bank she smiled,<br/>
			Bearing full many colours in her hands,<br/>
			Which that high land produces without seed.</p>
			<p>Apart three paces did the river make us;<br/>
			But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across,<br/>
			(A curb still to all human arrogance,)</p>
			<p>More hatred from Leander did not suffer<br/>
			For rolling between Sestos and Abydos,<br/>
			Than that from me, because it oped not then.</p>
			<p>"Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,"<br/>
			Began she, "peradventure, in this place<br/>
			Elect to human nature for its nest,</p>
			<p>Some apprehension keeps you marvelling;<br/>
			But the psalm 'Delectasti' giveth light<br/>
			Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.</p>
			<p>And thou who foremost art, and didst entreat me,<br/>
			Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready<br/>
			To all thy questionings, as far as needful."</p>
			<p>"The water," said I, "and the forest's sound,<br/>
			Are combating within me my new faith<br/>
			In something which I heard opposed to this."</p>
			<p>Whence she: "I will relate how from its cause<br/>
			Proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder,<br/>
			And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee.</p>
			<p>The Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting,<br/>
			Created man good, and this goodly place<br/>
			Gave him as hansel of eternal peace.</p>
			<p>By his default short while he sojourned here;<br/>
			By his default to weeping and to toil<br/>
			He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play.</p>
			<p>That the disturbance which below is made<br/>
			By exhalations of the land and water,<br/>
			(Which far as may be follow after heat,)</p>
			<p>Might not upon mankind wage any war,<br/>
			This mount ascended tow'rds the heaven so high,<br/>
			And is exempt, from there where it is locked.</p>
			<p>Now since the universal atmosphere<br/>
			Turns in a circuit with the primal motion<br/>
			Unless the circle is broken on some side,</p>
			<p>Upon this height, that all is disengaged<br/>
			In living ether, doth this motion strike<br/>
			And make the forest sound, for it is dense;</p>
			<p>And so much power the stricken plant possesses<br/>
			That with its virtue it impregns the air,<br/>
			And this, revolving, scatters it around;</p>
			<p>And yonder earth, according as 'tis worthy<br/>
			In self or in its clime, conceives and bears<br/>
			Of divers qualities the divers trees;</p>
			<p>It should not seem a marvel then on earth,<br/>
			This being heard, whenever any plant<br/>
			Without seed manifest there taketh root.</p>
			<p>And thou must know, this holy table-land<br/>
			In which thou art is full of every seed,<br/>
			And fruit has in it never gathered there.</p>
			<p>The water which thou seest springs not from vein<br/>
			Restored by vapour that the cold condenses,<br/>
			Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;</p>
			<p>But issues from a fountain safe and certain,<br/>
			Which by the will of God as much regains<br/>
			As it discharges, open on two sides.</p>
			<p>Upon this side with virtue it descends,<br/>
			Which takes away all memory of sin;<br/>
			On that, of every good deed done restores it.</p>
			<p>Here Lethe, as upon the other side<br/>
			Eunoe, it is called; and worketh not<br/>
			If first on either side it be not tasted.</p>
			<p>This every other savour doth transcend;<br/>
			And notwithstanding slaked so far may be<br/>
			Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,</p>
			<p>I'll give thee a corollary still in grace,<br/>
			Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear<br/>
			If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.</p>
			<p>Those who in ancient times have feigned in song<br/>
			The Age of Gold and its felicity,<br/>
			Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.</p>
			<p>Here was the human race in innocence;<br/>
			Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;<br/>
			This is the nectar of which each one speaks."</p>
			<p>Then backward did I turn me wholly round<br/>
			Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile<br/>
			They had been listening to these closing words;</p>
			<p>Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXIX</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Singing like unto an enamoured lady<br/>
			She, with the ending of her words, continued:<br/>
			"Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata."</p>
			<p>And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone<br/>
			Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous<br/>
			One to avoid and one to see the sun,</p>
			<p>She then against the stream moved onward, going<br/>
			Along the bank, and I abreast of her,<br/>
			Her little steps with little steps attending.</p>
			<p>Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,<br/>
			When equally the margins gave a turn,<br/>
			In such a way, that to the East I faced.</p>
			<p>Nor even thus our way continued far<br/>
			Before the lady wholly turned herself<br/>
			Unto me, saying, "Brother, look and listen!"</p>
			<p>And lo! a sudden lustre ran across<br/>
			On every side athwart the spacious forest,<br/>
			Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.</p>
			<p>But since the lightning ceases as it comes,<br/>
			And that continuing brightened more and more,<br/>
			Within my thought I said, "What thing is this?"</p>
			<p>And a delicious melody there ran<br/>
			Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal<br/>
			Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;</p>
			<p>For there where earth and heaven obedient were,<br/>
			The woman only, and but just created,<br/>
			Could not endure to stay 'neath any veil;</p>
			<p>Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,<br/>
			I sooner should have tasted those delights<br/>
			Ineffable, and for a longer time.</p>
			<p>While 'mid such manifold first-fruits I walked<br/>
			Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,<br/>
			And still solicitous of more delights,</p>
			<p>In front of us like an enkindled fire<br/>
			Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,<br/>
			And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.</p>
			<p>O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,<br/>
			Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,<br/>
			The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!</p>
			<p>Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,<br/>
			And with her choir Urania must assist me,<br/>
			To put in verse things difficult to think.</p>
			<p>A little farther on, seven trees of gold<br/>
			In semblance the long space still intervening<br/>
			Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;</p>
			<p>But when I had approached so near to them<br/>
			The common object, which the sense deceives,<br/>
			Lost not by distance any of its marks,</p>
			<p>The faculty that lends discourse to reason<br/>
			Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,<br/>
			And in the voices of the song "Hosanna!"</p>
			<p>Above them flamed the harness beautiful,<br/>
			Far brighter than the moon in the serene<br/>
			Of midnight, at the middle of her month.</p>
			<p>I turned me round, with admiration filled,<br/>
			To good Virgilius, and he answered me<br/>
			With visage no less full of wonderment.</p>
			<p>Then back I turned my face to those high things,<br/>
			Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,<br/>
			They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.</p>
			<p>The lady chid me: "Why dost thou burn only<br/>
			So with affection for the living lights,<br/>
			And dost not look at what comes after them?"</p>
			<p>Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,<br/>
			Coming behind them, garmented in white,<br/>
			And such a whiteness never was on earth.</p>
			<p>The water on my left flank was resplendent,<br/>
			And back to me reflected my left side,<br/>
			E'en as a mirror, if I looked therein.</p>
			<p>When I upon my margin had such post<br/>
			That nothing but the stream divided us,<br/>
			Better to see I gave my steps repose;</p>
			<p>And I beheld the flamelets onward go,<br/>
			Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,<br/>
			And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,</p>
			<p>So that it overhead remained distinct<br/>
			With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours<br/>
			Whence the sun's bow is made, and Delia's girdle.</p>
			<p>These standards to the rearward longer were<br/>
			Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,<br/>
			Ten paces were the outermost apart.</p>
			<p>Under so fair a heaven as I describe<br/>
			The four and twenty Elders, two by two,<br/>
			Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.</p>
			<p>They all of them were singing: "Blessed thou<br/>
			Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed<br/>
			For evermore shall be thy loveliness."</p>
			<p>After the flowers and other tender grasses<br/>
			In front of me upon the other margin<br/>
			Were disencumbered of that race elect,</p>
			<p>Even as in heaven star followeth after star,<br/>
			There came close after them four animals,<br/>
			Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.</p>
			<p>Plumed with six wings was every one of them,<br/>
			The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus<br/>
			If they were living would be such as these.</p>
			<p>Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste<br/>
			My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,<br/>
			That I in this cannot be prodigal.</p>
			<p>But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them<br/>
			As he beheld them from the region cold<br/>
			Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;</p>
			<p>And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,<br/>
			Such were they here; saving that in their plumage<br/>
			John is with me, and differeth from him.</p>
			<p>The interval between these four contained<br/>
			A chariot triumphal on two wheels,<br/>
			Which by a Griffin's neck came drawn along;</p>
			<p>And upward he extended both his wings<br/>
			Between the middle list and three and three,<br/>
			So that he injured none by cleaving it.</p>
			<p>So high they rose that they were lost to sight;<br/>
			His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,<br/>
			And white the others with vermilion mingled.</p>
			<p>Not only Rome with no such splendid car<br/>
			E'er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus,<br/>
			But poor to it that of the Sun would be,—</p>
			<p>That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up<br/>
			At the importunate orison of Earth,<br/>
			When Jove was so mysteriously just.</p>
			<p>Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle<br/>
			Came onward dancing; one so very red<br/>
			That in the fire she hardly had been noted.</p>
			<p>The second was as if her flesh and bones<br/>
			Had all been fashioned out of emerald;<br/>
			The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.</p>
			<p>And now they seemed conducted by the white,<br/>
			Now by the red, and from the song of her<br/>
			The others took their step, or slow or swift.</p>
			<p>Upon the left hand four made holiday<br/>
			Vested in purple, following the measure<br/>
			Of one of them with three eyes m her head.</p>
			<p>In rear of all the group here treated of<br/>
			Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,<br/>
			But like in gait, each dignified and grave.</p>
			<p>One showed himself as one of the disciples<br/>
			Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature<br/>
			Made for the animals she holds most dear;</p>
			<p>Contrary care the other manifested,<br/>
			With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused<br/>
			Terror to me on this side of the river.</p>
			<p>Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect,<br/>
			And behind all an aged man alone<br/>
			Walking in sleep with countenance acute.</p>
			<p>And like the foremost company these seven<br/>
			Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce<br/>
			No garland round about the head they wore,</p>
			<p>But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;<br/>
			At little distance would the sight have sworn<br/>
			That all were in a flame above their brows.</p>
			<p>And when the car was opposite to me<br/>
			Thunder was heard; and all that folk august<br/>
			Seemed to have further progress interdicted,</p>
			<p>There with the vanward ensigns standing still.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXX</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">When the Septentrion of the highest heaven<br/>

			<p>Motionless halted, the veracious people,<br/>
			That came at first between it and the Griffin,<br/>
			Turned themselves to the car, as to their peace.</p>
			<p>And one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned,<br/>
			Singing, "Veni, sponsa, de Libano"<br/>
			Shouted three times, and all the others after.</p>
			<p>Even as the Blessed at the final summons<br/>

			<p>They all were saying, "Benedictus qui venis,"<br/>

			<p>Ere now have I beheld, as day began,<br/>
			The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,<br/>
			And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;</p>

			So that by tempering influence of vapours<br/>
			For a long interval the eye sustained it;</p>
			<p>Thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers<br/>
			Which from those hands angelical ascended,<br/>
			And downward fell again inside and out,</p>
			<p>Over her snow-white veil with olive cinct<br/>
			Appeared a lady under a green mantle,<br/>
			Vested in colour of the living flame.</p>
			<p>And my own spirit, that already now<br/>
			So long a time had been, that in her presence<br/>
			Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,</p>
			<p>Without more knowledge having by mine eyes,<br/>
			Through occult virtue that from her proceeded<br/>
			Of ancient love the mighty influence felt.</p>
			<p>As soon as on my vision smote the power<br/>
			Sublime, that had already pierced me through<br/>
			Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,</p>
			<p>To the left hand I turned with that reliance<br/>
			With which the little child runs to his mother,<br/>
			When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,</p>
			<p>To say unto Virgilius: "Not a drachm<br/>
			Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble;<br/>
			I know the traces of the ancient flame."</p>
			<p>But us Virgilius of himself deprived<br/>
			Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers,<br/>
			Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:</p>
			<p>Nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother<br/>
			Availed my cheeks now purified from dew,<br/>
			That weeping they should not again be darkened.</p>
			<p>"Dante, because Virgilius has departed<br/>
			Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile;<br/>
			For by another sword thou need'st must weep."</p>
			<p>E'en as an admiral, who on poop and prow<br/>
			Comes to behold the people that are working<br/>
			In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing,</p>
			<p>Upon the left hand border of the car,<br/>
			When at the sound I turned of my own name,<br/>
			Which of necessity is here recorded,</p>
			<p>I saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared<br/>
			Veiled underneath the angelic festival,<br/>
			Direct her eyes to me across the river.</p>
			<p>Although the veil, that from her head descended,<br/>
			Encircled with the foliage of Minerva,<br/>
			Did not permit her to appear distinctly,</p>
			<p>In attitude still royally majestic<br/>
			Continued she, like unto one who speaks,<br/>
			And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve:</p>
			<p>"Look at me well; in sooth I'm Beatrice!<br/>
			How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain?<br/>
			Didst thou not know that man is happy here?"</p>
			<p>Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain,<br/>
			But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass,<br/>
			So great a shame did weigh my forehead down.</p>
			<p>As to the son the mother seems superb,<br/>
			So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter<br/>
			Tasteth the savour of severe compassion.</p>
			<p>Silent became she, and the Angels sang<br/>
			Suddenly, "In te, Domine, speravi:"<br/>
			But beyond 'pedes meos' did not pass.</p>
			<p>Even as the snow among the living rafters<br/>
			Upon the back of Italy congeals,<br/>
			Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds,</p>
			<p>And then, dissolving, trickles through itself<br/>
			Whene'er the land that loses shadow breathes,<br/>
			So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;</p>
			<p>E'en thus was I without a tear or sigh,<br/>
			Before the song of those who sing for ever<br/>
			After the music of the eternal spheres.</p>
			<p>But when I heard in their sweet melodies<br/>
			Compassion for me, more than had they said,<br/>
			"O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?"</p>
			<p>The ice, that was about my heart congealed,<br/>
			To air and water changed, and in my anguish<br/>
			Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.</p>
			<p>She, on the right-hand border of the car<br/>
			Still firmly standing, to those holy beings<br/>
			Thus her discourse directed afterwards:</p>
			<p>"Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,<br/>
			So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you<br/>
			One step the ages make upon their path;</p>
			<p>Therefore my answer is with greater care,<br/>
			That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,<br/>
			So that the sin and dole be of one measure.</p>
			<p>Not only by the work of those great wheels,<br/>
			That destine every seed unto some end,<br/>
			According as the stars are in conjunction,</p>
			<p>But by the largess of celestial graces,<br/>
			Which have such lofty vapours for their rain<br/>
			That near to them our sight approaches not,</p>
			<p>Such had this man become in his new life<br/>
			Potentially, that every righteous habit<br/>
			Would have made admirable proof in him;</p>
			<p>But so much more malignant and more savage<br/>
			Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,<br/>
			The more good earthly vigour it possesses.</p>
			<p>Some time did I sustain him with my look;<br/>
			Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,<br/>
			I led him with me turned in the right way.</p>
			<p>As soon as ever of my second age<br/>
			I was upon the threshold and changed life,<br/>
			Himself from me he took and gave to others.</p>
			<p>When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,<br/>
			And beauty and virtue were in me increased,<br/>
			I was to him less dear and less delightful;</p>
			<p>And into ways untrue he turned his steps,<br/>
			Pursuing the false images of good,<br/>
			That never any promises fulfil;</p>
			<p>Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,<br/>
			By means of which in dreams and otherwise<br/>
			I called him back, so little did he heed them.</p>
			<p>So low he fell, that all appliances<br/>
			For his salvation were already short,<br/>
			Save showing him the people of perdition.</p>
			<p>For this I visited the gates of death,<br/>
			And unto him, who so far up has led him,<br/>
			My intercessions were with weeping borne.</p>
			<p>God's lofty fiat would be violated,<br/>
			If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands<br/>
			Should tasted be, withouten any scot</p>
			<p>Of penitence, that gushes forth in tears."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXXI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">"O thou who art beyond the sacred river,"<br/>
			Turning to me the point of her discourse,<br/>
			That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,</p>
			<p>She recommenced, continuing without pause,<br/>
			"Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,<br/>
			Thy own confession needs must be conjoined."</p>
			<p>My faculties were in so great confusion,<br/>
			That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct<br/>
			Than by its organs it was set at large.</p>
			<p>Awhile she waited; then she said: "What thinkest?<br/>
			Answer me; for the mournful memories<br/>
			In thee not yet are by the waters injured."</p>
			<p>Confusion and dismay together mingled<br/>
			Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight<br/>
			Was needful to the understanding of it.</p>
			<p>Even as a cross-bow breaks, when 'tis discharged<br/>
			Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,<br/>
			And with less force the arrow hits the mark,</p>
			<p>So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,<br/>
			Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,<br/>
			And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.</p>
			<p>Whence she to me: "In those desires of mine<br/>
			Which led thee to the loving of that good,<br/>
			Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,</p>
			<p>What trenches lying traverse or what chains<br/>
			Didst thou discover, that of passing onward<br/>
			Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?</p>
			<p>And what allurements or what vantages<br/>
			Upon the forehead of the others showed,<br/>
			That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?"</p>
			<p>After the heaving of a bitter sigh,<br/>
			Hardly had I the voice to make response,<br/>
			And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.</p>
			<p>Weeping I said: "The things that present were<br/>
			With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,<br/>
			Soon as your countenance concealed itself."</p>
			<p>And she: "Shouldst thou be silent, or deny<br/>
			What thou confessest, not less manifest<br/>
			Would be thy fault, by such a Judge 'tis known.</p>
			<p>But when from one's own cheeks comes bursting forth<br/>
			The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal<br/>
			Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.</p>
			<p>But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame<br/>
			For thy transgression, and another time<br/>
			Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,</p>
			<p>Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;<br/>
			So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way<br/>
			My buried flesh should have directed thee.</p>
			<p>Never to thee presented art or nature<br/>
			Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein<br/>
			I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.</p>
			<p>And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee<br/>
			By reason of my death, what mortal thing<br/>
			Should then have drawn thee into its desire?</p>
			<p>Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft<br/>
			Of things fallacious to have risen up<br/>
			To follow me, who was no longer such.</p>
			<p>Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward<br/>
			To wait for further blows, or little girl,<br/>
			Or other vanity of such brief use.</p>
			<p>The callow birdlet waits for two or three,<br/>
			But to the eyes of those already fledged,<br/>
			In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot."</p>
			<p>Even as children silent in their shame<br/>
			Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,<br/>
			And conscious of their fault, and penitent;</p>
			<p>So was I standing; and she said: "If thou<br/>
			In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard<br/>
			And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing."</p>
			<p>With less resistance is a robust holm<br/>
			Uprooted, either by a native wind<br/>
			Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,</p>
			<p>Than I upraised at her command my chin;<br/>
			And when she by the beard the face demanded,<br/>
			Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.</p>
			<p>And as my countenance was lifted up,<br/>
			Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful<br/>
			Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;</p>
			<p>And, still but little reassured, mine eyes<br/>
			Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,<br/>
			That is one person only in two natures.</p>
			<p>Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,<br/>
			She seemed to me far more her ancient self<br/>
			To excel, than others here, when she was here.</p>
			<p>So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,<br/>
			That of all other things the one which turned me<br/>
			Most to its love became the most my foe.</p>
			<p>Such self-conviction stung me at the heart<br/>
			O'erpowered I fell, and what I then became<br/>
			She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.</p>
			<p>Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,<br/>
			The lady I had found alone, above me<br/>
			I saw, and she was saying, "Hold me, hold me."</p>
			<p>Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,<br/>
			And, dragging me behind her, she was moving<br/>
			Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.</p>
			<p>When I was near unto the blessed shore,<br/>
			"Asperges me," I heard so sweetly sung,<br/>
			Remember it I cannot, much less write it.</p>
			<p>The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,<br/>
			Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,<br/>
			Where I was forced to swallow of the water.</p>
			<p>Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought<br/>
			Into the dance of the four beautiful,<br/>
			And each one with her arm did cover me.</p>
			<p>'We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;<br/>
			Ere Beatrice descended to the world,<br/>
			We as her handmaids were appointed her.</p>
			<p>We'll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant<br/>
			Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine<br/>
			The three beyond, who more profoundly look.'</p>
			<p>Thus singing they began; and afterwards<br/>
			Unto the Griffin's breast they led me with them,<br/>
			Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.</p>
			<p>"See that thou dost not spare thine eyes," they said;<br/>
			"Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,<br/>
			Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons."</p>
			<p>A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,<br/>
			Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,<br/>
			That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.</p>
			<p>As in a glass the sun, not otherwise<br/>
			Within them was the twofold monster shining,<br/>
			Now with the one, now with the other nature.</p>
			<p>Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,<br/>
			When I beheld the thing itself stand still,<br/>
			And in its image it transformed itself.</p>
			<p>While with amazement filled and jubilant,<br/>
			My soul was tasting of the food, that while<br/>
			It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,</p>
			<p>Themselves revealing of the highest rank<br/>
			In bearing, did the other three advance,<br/>
			Singing to their angelic saraband.</p>
			<p>"Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,"<br/>
			Such was their song, "unto thy faithful one,<br/>
			Who has to see thee ta'en so many steps.</p>
			<p>In grace do us the grace that thou unveil<br/>
			Thy face to him, so that he may discern<br/>
			The second beauty which thou dost conceal."</p>
			<p>O splendour of the living light eternal!<br/>
			Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus<br/>
			Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,</p>
			<p>He would not seem to have his mind encumbered<br/>
			Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,<br/>
			Where the harmonious heaven o'ershadowed thee,</p>
			<p>When in the open air thou didst unveil?</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXXII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">So steadfast and attentive were mine eyes<br/>
			In satisfying their decennial thirst,<br/>
			That all my other senses were extinct,</p>
			<p>And upon this side and on that they had<br/>
			Walls of indifference, so the holy smile<br/>
			Drew them unto itself with the old net</p>
			<p>When forcibly my sight was turned away<br/>
			Towards my left hand by those goddesses,<br/>
			Because I heard from them a "Too intently!"</p>
			<p>And that condition of the sight which is<br/>

			Angelic music made our steps keep time.</p>
			<p>Perchance as great a space had in three flights<br/>
			An arrow loosened from the string o'erpassed,<br/>
			As we had moved when Beatrice descended.</p>
			<p>I heard them murmur altogether, "Adam!"<br/>
			Then circled they about a tree despoiled<br/>
			Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.</p>
			<p>Its tresses, which so much the more dilate<br/>
			As higher they ascend, had been by Indians<br/>
			Among their forests marvelled at for height.</p>
			<p>"Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not<br/>
			Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste,<br/>
			Since appetite by this was turned to evil."</p>
			<p>After this fashion round the tree robust<br/>
			The others shouted; and the twofold creature:<br/>
			"Thus is preserved the seed of all the just."</p>
			<p>And turning to the pole which he had dragged,<br/>
			He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,<br/>
			And what was of it unto it left bound.</p>
			<p>In the same manner as our trees (when downward<br/>
			Falls the great light, with that together mingled<br/>
			Which after the celestial Lasca shines)</p>
			<p>Begin to swell, and then renew themselves,<br/>
			Each one with its own colour, ere the Sun<br/>
			Harness his steeds beneath another star:</p>
			<p>Less than of rose and more than violet<br/>
			A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree<br/>
			That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.</p>
			<p>I never heard, nor here below is sung,<br/>
			The hymn which afterward that people sang,<br/>
			Nor did I bear the melody throughout.</p>
			<p>Had I the power to paint how fell asleep<br/>
			Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,<br/>
			Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,</p>
			<p>Even as a painter who from model paints<br/>
			I would portray how I was lulled asleep;<br/>
			He may, who well can picture drowsihood.</p>
			<p>Therefore I pass to what time I awoke,<br/>
			And say a splendour rent from me the veil<br/>
			Of slumber, and a calling: "Rise, what dost thou?"</p>
			<p>As to behold the apple-tree in blossom<br/>
			Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,<br/>
			And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,</p>
			<p>Peter and John and James conducted were,<br/>
			And, overcome, recovered at the word<br/>
			By which still greater slumbers have been broken,</p>
			<p>And saw their school diminished by the loss<br/>
			Not only of Elias, but of Moses,<br/>
			And the apparel of their Master changed;</p>
			<p>So I revived, and saw that piteous one<br/>
			Above me standing, who had been conductress<br/>
			Aforetime of my steps beside the river,</p>
			<p>And all in doubt I said, "Where's Beatrice?"<br/>
			And she: "Behold her seated underneath<br/>
			The leafage new, upon the root of it.</p>
			<p>Behold the company that circles her;<br/>
			The rest behind the Griffin are ascending<br/>
			With more melodious song, and more profound."</p>
			<p>And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,<br/>
			Because already in my sight was she<br/>
			Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.</p>
			<p>Alone she sat upon the very earth,<br/>
			Left there as guardian of the chariot<br/>
			Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.</p>
			<p>Encircling her, a cloister made themselves<br/>
			The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands<br/>
			Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.</p>
			<p>"Short while shalt thou be here a forester,<br/>
			And thou shalt be with me for evermore<br/>
			A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.</p>
			<p>Therefore, for that world's good which liveth ill,<br/>
			Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,<br/>
			Having returned to earth, take heed thou write."</p>
			<p>Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet<br/>
			Of her commandments all devoted was,<br/>
			My mind and eyes directed where she willed.</p>
			<p>Never descended with so swift a motion<br/>
			Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining<br/>
			From out the region which is most remote,</p>
			<p>As I beheld the bird of Jove descend<br/>
			Down through the tree, rending away the bark,<br/>
			As well as blossoms and the foliage new,</p>
			<p>And he with all his might the chariot smote,<br/>
			Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest<br/>
			Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.</p>
			<p>Thereafter saw I leap into the body<br/>
			Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,<br/>
			That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.</p>
			<p>But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,<br/>
			My Lady put him to as swift a flight<br/>
			As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.</p>
			<p>Then by the way that it before had come,<br/>
			Into the chariot's chest I saw the Eagle<br/>
			Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.</p>
			<p>And such as issues from a heart that mourns,<br/>
			A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:<br/>
			"My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!"</p>
			<p>Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between<br/>
			Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,<br/>
			Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,</p>
			<p>And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,<br/>
			Drawing unto himself his tail malign,<br/>
			Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.</p>
			<p>That which remained behind, even as with grass<br/>
			A fertile region, with the feathers, offered<br/>
			Perhaps with pure intention and benign,</p>
			<p>Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed<br/>
			The pole and both the wheels so speedily,<br/>
			A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.</p>
			<p>Transfigured thus the holy edifice<br/>
			Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,<br/>
			Three on the pole and one at either corner.</p>
			<p>The first were horned like oxen; but the four<br/>
			Had but a single horn upon the forehead;<br/>
			A monster such had never yet been seen!</p>
			<p>Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,<br/>
			Seated upon it, there appeared to me<br/>
			A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,</p>
			<p>And, as if not to have her taken from him,<br/>
			Upright beside her I beheld a giant;<br/>
			And ever and anon they kissed each other.</p>
			<p>But because she her wanton, roving eye<br/>
			Turned upon me, her angry paramour<br/>
			Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.</p>
			<p>Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,<br/>
			He loosed the monster, and across the forest<br/>
			Dragged it so far, he made of that alone</p>
			<p>A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXXIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">"Deus venerunt gentes," alternating<br/>
			Now three, now four, melodious psalmody<br/>
			The maidens in the midst of tears began;</p>
			<p>And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,<br/>
			Listened to them with such a countenance,<br/>
			That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.</p>
			<p>But when the other virgins place had given<br/>
			For her to speak, uprisen to her feet<br/>
			With colour as of fire, she made response:</p>
			<p>"'Modicum, et non videbitis me;<br/>
			Et iterum,' my sisters predilect,<br/>
			'Modicum, et vos videbitis me.'"</p>
			<p>Then all the seven in front of her she placed;<br/>
			And after her, by beckoning only, moved<br/>
			Me and the lady and the sage who stayed.</p>
			<p>So she moved onward; and I do not think<br/>
			That her tenth step was placed upon the ground,<br/>
			When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote,</p>
			<p>And with a tranquil aspect, "Come more quickly,"<br/>
			To me she said, "that, if I speak with thee,<br/>
			To listen to me thou mayst be well placed."</p>
			<p>As soon as I was with her as I should be,<br/>
			She said to me: "Why, brother, dost thou not<br/>
			Venture to question now, in coming with me?"</p>
			<p>As unto those who are too reverential,<br/>
			Speaking in presence of superiors,<br/>
			Who drag no living utterance to their teeth,</p>
			<p>It me befell, that without perfect sound<br/>
			Began I: "My necessity, Madonna,<br/>
			You know, and that which thereunto is good."</p>
			<p>And she to me: "Of fear and bashfulness<br/>
			Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself,<br/>
			So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.</p>
			<p>Know that the vessel which the serpent broke<br/>
			Was, and is not; but let him who is guilty<br/>
			Think that God's vengeance does not fear a sop.</p>
			<p>Without an heir shall not for ever be<br/>
			The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car,<br/>
			Whence it became a monster, then a prey;</p>
			<p>For verily I see, and hence narrate it,<br/>
			The stars already near to bring the time,<br/>
			From every hindrance safe, and every bar,</p>
			<p>Within which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five,<br/>
			One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman<br/>
			And that same giant who is sinning with her.</p>
			<p>And peradventure my dark utterance,<br/>
			Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee,<br/>
			Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect;</p>
			<p>But soon the facts shall be the Naiades<br/>
			Who shall this difficult enigma solve,<br/>
			Without destruction of the flocks and harvests.</p>
			<p>Note thou; and even as by me are uttered<br/>
			These words, so teach them unto those who live<br/>
			That life which is a running unto death;</p>
			<p>And bear in mind, whene'er thou writest them,<br/>
			Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant,<br/>
			That twice already has been pillaged here.</p>
			<p>Whoever pillages or shatters it,<br/>
			With blasphemy of deed offendeth God,<br/>
			Who made it holy for his use alone.</p>
			<p>For biting that, in pain and in desire<br/>
			Five thousand years and more the first-born soul<br/>
			Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.</p>
			<p>Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not<br/>
			For special reason so pre-eminent<br/>
			In height, and so inverted in its summit.</p>
			<p>And if thy vain imaginings had not been<br/>
			Water of Elsa round about thy mind,<br/>
			And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,</p>
			<p>Thou by so many circumstances only<br/>
			The justice of the interdict of God<br/>
			Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.</p>
			<p>But since I see thee in thine intellect<br/>
			Converted into stone and stained with sin,<br/>
			So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,</p>
			<p>I will too, if not written, at least painted,<br/>
			Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason<br/>
			That cinct with palm the pilgrim's staff is borne."</p>
			<p>And I: "As by a signet is the wax<br/>
			Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,<br/>
			My brain is now imprinted by yourself.</p>
			<p>But wherefore so beyond my power of sight<br/>
			Soars your desirable discourse, that aye<br/>
			The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?"</p>
			<p>"That thou mayst recognize," she said, "the school<br/>
			Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far<br/>
			Its doctrine follows after my discourse,</p>
			<p>And mayst behold your path from the divine<br/>
			Distant as far as separated is<br/>
			From earth the heaven that highest hastens on."</p>
			<p>Whence her I answered: "I do not remember<br/>
			That ever I estranged myself from you,<br/>
			Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me."</p>
			<p>"And if thou art not able to remember,"<br/>
			Smiling she answered, "recollect thee now<br/>
			That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;</p>
			<p>And if from smoke a fire may be inferred,<br/>
			Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates<br/>
			Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.</p>
			<p>Truly from this time forward shall my words<br/>
			Be naked, so far as it is befitting<br/>
			To lay them open unto thy rude gaze."</p>
			<p>And more coruscant and with slower steps<br/>
			The sun was holding the meridian circle,<br/>
			Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there</p>
			<p>When halted (as he cometh to a halt,<br/>
			Who goes before a squadron as its escort,<br/>
			If something new he find upon his way)</p>
			<p>The ladies seven at a dark shadow's edge,<br/>
			Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,<br/>
			The Alp upon its frigid border wears.</p>
			<p>In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates<br/>
			Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,<br/>
			And slowly part, like friends, from one another.</p>
			<p>"O light, O glory of the human race!<br/>
			What stream is this which here unfolds itself<br/>
			From out one source, and from itself withdraws?"</p>
			<p>For such a prayer, 'twas said unto me, "Pray<br/>
			Matilda that she tell thee;" and here answered,<br/>
			As one does who doth free himself from blame,</p>
			<p>The beautiful lady: "This and other things<br/>
			Were told to him by me; and sure I am<br/>
			The water of Lethe has not hid them from him."</p>
			<p>And Beatrice: "Perhaps a greater care,<br/>
			Which oftentimes our memory takes away,<br/>
			Has made the vision of his mind obscure.</p>
			<p>But Eunoe behold, that yonder rises;<br/>
			Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,<br/>
			Revive again the half-dead virtue in him."</p>
			<p>Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,<br/>
			But makes its own will of another's will<br/>
			As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,</p>
			<p>Even so, when she had taken hold of me,<br/>
			The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius<br/>
			Said, in her womanly manner, "Come with him."</p>
			<p>If, Reader, I possessed a longer space<br/>
			For writing it, I yet would sing in part<br/>
			Of the sweet draught that ne'er would satiate me;</p>
			<p>But inasmuch as full are all the leaves<br/>
			Made ready for this second canticle,<br/>
			The curb of art no farther lets me go.</p>
			<p>From the most holy water I returned<br/>
			Regenerate, in the manner of new trees<br/>
			That are renewed with a new foliage,</p>
			<p>Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars.</p>
