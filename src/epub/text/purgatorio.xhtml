			<h2>Purgatorio</h2>
			<p id="id01694" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto I</p>
			<p id="id01695" style="margin-top: 2em">To run o'er better waters hoists its sail<br/>
			The little vessel of my genius now,<br/>
			That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01696">And of that second kingdom will I sing<br/>
			Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,<br/>
			And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01697">But let dead Poesy here rise again,<br/>
			O holy Muses, since that I am yours,<br/>
			And here Calliope somewhat ascend,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01698">My song accompanying with that sound,<br/>
			Of which the miserable magpies felt<br/>
			The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01699">Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire,<br/>
			That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect<br/>
			Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01700">Unto mine eyes did recommence delight<br/>
			Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,<br/>
			Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01701">The beauteous planet, that to love incites,<br/>
			Was making all the orient to laugh,<br/>
			Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01702">To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind<br/>
			Upon the other pole, and saw four stars<br/>
			Ne'er seen before save by the primal people.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01703">Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.<br/>
			O thou septentrional and widowed site,<br/>
			Because thou art deprived of seeing these!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01704">When from regarding them I had withdrawn,<br/>
			Turning a little to the other pole,<br/>
			There where the Wain had disappeared already,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01705">I saw beside me an old man alone,<br/>
			Worthy of so much reverence in his look,<br/>
			That more owes not to father any son.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01706">A long beard and with white hair intermingled<br/>
			He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,<br/>
			Of which a double list fell on his breast.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01707">The rays of the four consecrated stars<br/>
			Did so adorn his countenance with light,<br/>
			That him I saw as were the sun before him.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01708">"Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,<br/>
			Have fled away from the eternal prison?"<br/>
			Moving those venerable plumes, he said:<br/></p>
			<p id="id01709">"Who guided you? or who has been your lamp<br/>
			In issuing forth out of the night profound,<br/>
			That ever black makes the infernal valley?<br/></p>
			<p id="id01710">The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?<br/>
			Or is there changed in heaven some council new,<br/>
			That being damned ye come unto my crags?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01711">Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,<br/>
			And with his words, and with his hands and signs,<br/>
			Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01712">Then answered him: "I came not of myself;<br/>
			A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers<br/>
			I aided this one with my company.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01713">But since it is thy will more be unfolded<br/>
			Of our condition, how it truly is,<br/>
			Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01714">This one has never his last evening seen,<br/>
			But by his folly was so near to it<br/>
			That very little time was there to turn.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01715">As I have said, I unto him was sent<br/>
			To rescue him, and other way was none<br/>
			Than this to which I have myself betaken.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01716">I've shown him all the people of perdition,<br/>
			And now those spirits I intend to show<br/>
			Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01717">How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.<br/>
			Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me<br/>
			To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01718">Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;<br/>
			He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,<br/>
			As knoweth he who life for her refuses.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01719">Thou know'st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter<br/>
			Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave<br/>
			The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01720">By us the eternal edicts are not broken;<br/>
			Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;<br/>
			But of that circle I, where are the chaste<br/></p>
			<p id="id01721">Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,<br/>
			O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;<br/>
			For her love, then, incline thyself to us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01722">Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;<br/>
			I will take back this grace from thee to her,<br/>
			If to be mentioned there below thou deignest."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01723">"Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes<br/>
			While I was on the other side," then said he,<br/>
			"That every grace she wished of me I granted;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01724">Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,<br/>
			She can no longer move me, by that law<br/>
			Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01725">But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,<br/>
			As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;<br/>
			Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01726">Go, then, and see thou gird this one about<br/>
			With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,<br/>
			So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01727">For 'twere not fitting that the eye o'ercast<br/>
			By any mist should go before the first<br/>
			Angel, who is of those of Paradise.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01728">This little island round about its base<br/>
			Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,<br/>
			Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01729">No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,<br/>
			Or that doth indurate, can there have life,<br/>
			Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01730">Thereafter be not this way your return;<br/>
			The sun, which now is rising, will direct you<br/>
			To take the mount by easier ascent."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01731">With this he vanished; and I raised me up<br/>
			Without a word, and wholly drew myself<br/>
			Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01732">And he began: "Son, follow thou my steps;<br/>
			Let us turn back, for on this side declines<br/>
			The plain unto its lower boundaries."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01733">The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour<br/>
			Which fled before it, so that from afar<br/>
			I recognised the trembling of the sea.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01734">Along the solitary plain we went<br/>
			As one who unto the lost road returns,<br/>
			And till he finds it seems to go in vain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01735">As soon as we were come to where the dew<br/>
			Fights with the sun, and, being in a part<br/>
			Where shadow falls, little evaporates,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01736">Both of his hands upon the grass outspread<br/>
			In gentle manner did my Master place;<br/>
			Whence I, who of his action was aware,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01737">Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;<br/>
			There did he make in me uncovered wholly<br/>
			That hue which Hell had covered up in me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01738">Then came we down upon the desert shore<br/>
			Which never yet saw navigate its waters<br/>
			Any that afterward had known return.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01739">There he begirt me as the other pleased;<br/>
			O marvellous! for even as he culled<br/>
			The humble plant, such it sprang up again<br/></p>
			<p id="id01740">Suddenly there where he uprooted it.</p>
			<p id="id01741" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto II</p>
			<p id="id01742" style="margin-top: 2em">Already had the sun the horizon reached<br/>
			Whose circle of meridian covers o'er<br/>
			Jerusalem with its most lofty point,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01743">And night that opposite to him revolves<br/>
			Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales<br/>
			That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01744">So that the white and the vermilion cheeks<br/>
			Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,<br/>
			By too great age were changing into orange.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01745">We still were on the border of the sea,<br/>
			Like people who are thinking of their road,<br/>
			Who go in heart and with the body stay;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01746">And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,<br/>
			Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red<br/>
			Down in the West upon the ocean floor,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01747">Appeared to me—may I again behold it!—<br/>
			A light along the sea so swiftly coming,<br/>
			Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01748">From which when I a little had withdrawn<br/>
			Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,<br/>
			Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01749">Then on each side of it appeared to me<br/>
			I knew not what of white, and underneath it<br/>
			Little by little there came forth another.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01750">My Master yet had uttered not a word<br/>
			While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;<br/>
			But when he clearly recognised the pilot,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01751">He cried: "Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!<br/>
			Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!<br/>
			Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01752">See how he scorneth human arguments,<br/>
			So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail<br/>
			Than his own wings, between so distant shores.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01753">See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,<br/>
			Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,<br/>
			That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01754">Then as still nearer and more near us came<br/>
			The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,<br/>
			So that near by the eye could not endure him,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01755">But down I cast it; and he came to shore<br/>
			With a small vessel, very swift and light,<br/>
			So that the water swallowed naught thereof.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01756">Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;<br/>
			Beatitude seemed written in his face,<br/>
			And more than a hundred spirits sat within.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01757">"In exitu Israel de Aegypto!"<br/>
			They chanted all together in one voice,<br/>
			With whatso in that psalm is after written.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01758">Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,<br/>
			Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,<br/>
			And he departed swiftly as he came.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01759">The throng which still remained there unfamiliar<br/>
			Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,<br/>
			As one who in new matters makes essay.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01760">On every side was darting forth the day.<br/>
			The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts<br/>
			From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01761">When the new people lifted up their faces<br/>
			Towards us, saying to us: "If ye know,<br/>
			Show us the way to go unto the mountain."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01762">And answer made Virgilius: "Ye believe<br/>
			Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,<br/>
			But we are strangers even as yourselves.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01763">Just now we came, a little while before you,<br/>
			Another way, which was so rough and steep,<br/>
			That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01764">The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,<br/>
			Become aware that I was still alive,<br/>
			Pallid in their astonishment became;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01765">And as to messenger who bears the olive<br/>
			The people throng to listen to the news,<br/>
			And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01766">So at the sight of me stood motionless<br/>
			Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if<br/>
			Oblivious to go and make them fair.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01767">One from among them saw I coming forward,<br/>
			As to embrace me, with such great affection,<br/>
			That it incited me to do the like.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01768">O empty shadows, save in aspect only!<br/>
			Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,<br/>
			As oft returned with them to my own breast!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01769">I think with wonder I depicted me;<br/>
			Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;<br/>
			And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01770">Gently it said that I should stay my steps;<br/>
			Then knew I who it was, and I entreated<br/>
			That it would stop awhile to speak with me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01771">It made reply to me: "Even as I loved thee<br/>
			In mortal body, so I love thee free;<br/>
			Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01772">"My own Casella! to return once more<br/>
			There where I am, I make this journey," said I;<br/>
			"But how from thee has so much time be taken?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01773">And he to me: "No outrage has been done me,<br/>
			If he who takes both when and whom he pleases<br/>
			Has many times denied to me this passage,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01774">For of a righteous will his own is made.<br/>
			He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken<br/>
			Whoever wished to enter with all peace;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01775">Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore<br/>
			Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,<br/>
			Benignantly by him have been received.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01776">Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,<br/>
			Because for evermore assemble there<br/>
			Those who tow'rds Acheron do not descend."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01777">And I: "If some new law take not from thee<br/>
			Memory or practice of the song of love,<br/>
			Which used to quiet in me all my longings,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01778">Thee may it please to comfort therewithal<br/>
			Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body<br/>
			Hitherward coming is so much distressed."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01779">"Love, that within my mind discourses with me,"<br/>
			Forthwith began he so melodiously,<br/>
			The melody within me still is sounding.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01780">My Master, and myself, and all that people<br/>
			Which with him were, appeared as satisfied<br/>
			As if naught else might touch the mind of any.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01781">We all of us were moveless and attentive<br/>
			Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,<br/>
			Exclaiming: "What is this, ye laggard spirits?<br/></p>
			<p id="id01782">What negligence, what standing still is this?<br/>
			Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,<br/>
			That lets not God be manifest to you."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01783">Even as when, collecting grain or tares,<br/>
			The doves, together at their pasture met,<br/>
			Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01784">If aught appear of which they are afraid,<br/>
			Upon a sudden leave their food alone,<br/>
			Because they are assailed by greater care;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01785">So that fresh company did I behold<br/>
			The song relinquish, and go tow'rds the hill,<br/>
			As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01786">Nor was our own departure less in haste.</p>
			<p id="id01787" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto III</p>
			<p id="id01788" style="margin-top: 2em">Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight<br/>
			Had scattered them asunder o'er the plain,<br/>
			Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01789">I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,<br/>
			And how without him had I kept my course?<br/>
			Who would have led me up along the mountain?<br/></p>
			<p id="id01790">He seemed to me within himself remorseful;<br/>
			O noble conscience, and without a stain,<br/>
			How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01791">After his feet had laid aside the haste<br/>
			Which mars the dignity of every act,<br/>
			My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01792">Let loose its faculties as if delighted,<br/>
			And I my sight directed to the hill<br/>
			That highest tow'rds the heaven uplifts itself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01793">The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,<br/>
			Was broken in front of me into the figure<br/>
			Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01794">Unto one side I turned me, with the fear<br/>
			Of being left alone, when I beheld<br/>
			Only in front of me the ground obscured.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01795">"Why dost thou still mistrust?" my Comforter<br/>
			Began to say to me turned wholly round;<br/>
			"Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?<br/></p>
			<p id="id01796">'Tis evening there already where is buried<br/>
			The body within which I cast a shadow;<br/>
			'Tis from Brundusium ta'en, and Naples has it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01797">Now if in front of me no shadow fall,<br/>
			Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,<br/>
			Because one ray impedeth not another<br/></p>
			<p id="id01798">To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,<br/>
			Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills<br/>
			That how it works be not unveiled to us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01799">Insane is he who hopeth that our reason<br/>
			Can traverse the illimitable way,<br/>
			Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01800">Mortals, remain contented at the 'Quia;'<br/>
			For if ye had been able to see all,<br/>
			No need there were for Mary to give birth;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01801">And ye have seen desiring without fruit,<br/>
			Those whose desire would have been quieted,<br/>
			Which evermore is given them for a grief.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01802">I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,<br/>
			And many others;"—and here bowed his head,<br/>
			And more he said not, and remained disturbed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01803">We came meanwhile unto the mountain's foot;<br/>
			There so precipitate we found the rock,<br/>
			That nimble legs would there have been in vain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01804">'Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,<br/>
			The most secluded pathway is a stair<br/>
			Easy and open, if compared with that.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01805">"Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill<br/>
			Slopes down," my Master said, his footsteps staying,<br/>
			"So that who goeth without wings may mount?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01806">And while he held his eyes upon the ground<br/>
			Examining the nature of the path,<br/>
			And I was looking up around the rock,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01807">On the left hand appeared to me a throng<br/>
			Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,<br/>
			And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01808">"Lift up thine eyes," I to the Master said;<br/>
			"Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,<br/>
			If thou of thine own self can have it not."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01809">Then he looked at me, and with frank expression<br/>
			Replied: "Let us go there, for they come slowly,<br/>
			And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01810">Still was that people as far off from us,<br/>
			After a thousand steps of ours I say,<br/>
			As a good thrower with his hand would reach,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01811">When they all crowded unto the hard masses<br/>
			Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,<br/>
			As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01812">"O happy dead!  O spirits elect already!"<br/>
			Virgilius made beginning, "by that peace<br/>
			Which I believe is waiting for you all,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01813">Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,<br/>
			So that the going up be possible,<br/>
			For to lose time irks him most who most knows."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01814">As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold<br/>
			By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand<br/>
			Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01815">And what the foremost does the others do,<br/>
			Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,<br/>
			Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01816">So moving to approach us thereupon<br/>
			I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,<br/>
			Modest in face and dignified in gait.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01817">As soon as those in the advance saw broken<br/>
			The light upon the ground at my right side,<br/>
			So that from me the shadow reached the rock,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01818">They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;<br/>
			And all the others, who came after them,<br/>
			Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01819">"Without your asking, I confess to you<br/>
			This is a human body which you see,<br/>
			Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01820">Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded<br/>
			That not without a power which comes from Heaven<br/>
			Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01821">The Master thus; and said those worthy people:<br/>
			"Return ye then, and enter in before us,"<br/>
			Making a signal with the back o' the hand<br/></p>
			<p id="id01822">And one of them began: "Whoe'er thou art,<br/>
			Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well<br/>
			If e'er thou saw me in the other world."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01823">I turned me tow'rds him, and looked at him closely;<br/>
			Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,<br/>
			But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01824">When with humility I had disclaimed<br/>
			E'er having seen him, "Now behold!" he said,<br/>
			And showed me high upon his breast a wound.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01825">Then said he with a smile: "I am Manfredi,<br/>
			The grandson of the Empress Costanza;<br/>
			Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee<br/></p>
			<p id="id01826">Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother<br/>
			Of Sicily's honour and of Aragon's,<br/>
			And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01827">After I had my body lacerated<br/>
			By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself<br/>
			Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01828">Horrible my iniquities had been;<br/>
			But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,<br/>
			That it receives whatever turns to it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01829">Had but Cosenza's pastor, who in chase<br/>
			Of me was sent by Clement at that time,<br/>
			In God read understandingly this page,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01830">The bones of my dead body still would be<br/>
			At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,<br/>
			Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01831">Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,<br/>
			Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,<br/>
			Where he transported them with tapers quenched.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01832">By malison of theirs is not so lost<br/>
			Eternal Love, that it cannot return,<br/>

			<p id="id01848">We mounted upward through the rifted rock,<br/>

			"My Master," said I, "what way shall we take?"<br/></p>

			Still up the mount behind me win thy way,<br/>

			<p id="id01851">The summit was so high it vanquished sight,<br/>
			And the hillside precipitous far more<br/>
			Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01852">Spent with fatigue was I, when I began:<br/>
			"O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold<br/>

			<p id="id01853">"O son," he said, "up yonder drag thyself,"<br/>

			<p id="id01854">These words of his so spurred me on, that I<br/>
			Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,<br/>
			Until the circle was beneath my feet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01855">Thereon ourselves we seated both of us<br/>
			Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,<br/>
			For all men are delighted to look back.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01856">To the low shores mine eyes I first directed,<br/>
			Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered<br/>
			That on the left hand we were smitten by it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01857">The Poet well perceived that I was wholly<br/>
			Bewildered at the chariot of the light,<br/>
			Where 'twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01858">Whereon he said to me: "If Castor and Pollux<br/>

			<p id="id01863">"Truly, my Master," said I, "never yet<br/>

			There where my wit appeared incompetent,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01864">That the mid-circle of supernal motion,<br/>

			Beheld it tow'rds the region of the heat.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01866">But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn<br/>
			How far we have to go; for the hill rises<br/>
			Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01867">And he to me: "This mount is such, that ever<br/>
			At the beginning down below 'tis tiresome,<br/>
			And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01868">Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,<br/>
			That going up shall be to thee as easy<br/>
			As going down the current in a boat,<br/></p>

			There to repose thy panting breath expect;<br/>
			No more I answer; and this I know for true."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01870">And as he finished uttering these words,<br/>
			A voice close by us sounded: "Peradventure<br/>
			Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01871">At sound thereof each one of us turned round,<br/>
			And saw upon the left hand a great rock,<br/>
			Which neither I nor he before had noticed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01872">Thither we drew; and there were persons there<br/>
			Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,<br/>
			As one through indolence is wont to stand.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01873">And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,<br/>
			Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,<br/>
			Holding his face low down between them bowed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01874">"O my sweet Lord," I said, "do turn thine eye<br/>
			On him who shows himself more negligent<br/>
			Then even Sloth herself his sister were."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01875">Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,<br/>
			Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,<br/>
			And said: "Now go thou up, for thou art valiant."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01876">Then knew I who he was; and the distress,<br/>
			That still a little did my breathing quicken,<br/>
			My going to him hindered not; and after<br/></p>
			<p id="id01877">I came to him he hardly raised his head,<br/>
			Saying: "Hast thou seen clearly how the sun<br/>
			O'er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01878">His sluggish attitude and his curt words<br/>
			A little unto laughter moved my lips;<br/>
			Then I began: "Belacqua, I grieve not<br/></p>
			<p id="id01879">For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated<br/>
			In this place art thou?  Waitest thou an escort?<br/>
			Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01880">And he: "O brother, what's the use of climbing?<br/>
			Since to my torment would not let me go<br/>
			The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01881">First heaven must needs so long revolve me round<br/>
			Outside thereof, as in my life it did,<br/>
			Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01882">Unless, e'er that, some prayer may bring me aid<br/>
			Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;<br/>
			What profit others that in heaven are heard not?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01883">Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,<br/>

			<p id="id01885" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto V</p>

			<p id="id01887">One shouted: "See, it seems as if shone not<br/>

			And like one living seems he to conduct him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01888">Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,<br/>

			But me, but me, and the light which was broken!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01889">"Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,"<br/>

			Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01893">Meanwhile along the mountain-side across<br/>
			Came people in advance of us a little,<br/>
			Singing the Miserere verse by verse.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01894">When they became aware I gave no place<br/>
			For passage of the sunshine through my body,<br/>
			They changed their song into a long, hoarse "Oh!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01895">And two of them, in form of messengers,<br/>
			Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,<br/>
			"Of your condition make us cognisant."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01896">And said my Master: "Ye can go your way<br/>

			Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01899">But upward they returned in briefer time,<br/>
			And, on arriving, with the others wheeled<br/>
			Tow'rds us, like troops that run without a rein.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01900">"This folk that presses unto us is great,<br/>

			"So still go onward, and in going listen."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01901">"O soul that goest to beatitude<br/>

			So that o'er yonder thou bear news of him;<br/>
			Ah, why dost thou go on?  Ah, why not stay?<br/></p>
			<p id="id01903">Long since we all were slain by violence,<br/>

			Then did a light from heaven admonish us,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01904">So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth<br/>

			<p id="id01905">And I: "Although I gaze into your faces,<br/>

			I still should be o'er yonder where men breathe.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01913">I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire<br/>
			Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there<br/>
			A lake made from my veins upon the ground."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01914">Then said another: "Ah, be that desire<br/>
			Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,<br/>
			As thou with pious pity aidest mine.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01915">I was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;<br/>

			<p id="id01917">"Oh," he replied, "at Casentino's foot<br/>
			A river crosses named Archiano, born<br/>
			Above the Hermitage in Apennine.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01918">There where the name thereof becometh void<br/>
			Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,<br/>
			Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01919">There my sight lost I, and my utterance<br/>
			Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat<br/>

			<p id="id01920">Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;<br/>
			God's Angel took me up, and he of hell<br/>
			Shouted: 'O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?<br/></p>
			<p id="id01921">Thou bearest away the eternal part of him,<br/>
			For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;<br/>
			But with the rest I'll deal in other fashion!'<br/></p>

			That humid vapour which to water turns,<br/>
			Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.<br/></p>

			<p id="id02259">He led us on to where the rock was cleft;<br/>
			There smote upon my forehead with his wings,<br/>
			Then a safe passage promised unto me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02260">As on the right hand, to ascend the mount<br/>
			Where seated is the church that lordeth it<br/>
			O'er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02261">The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken<br/>
			By stairways that were made there in the age<br/>
			When still were safe the ledger and the stave,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02262">E'en thus attempered is the bank which falls<br/>
			Sheer downward from the second circle there;<br/>
			But on this, side and that the high rock graze.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02263">As we were turning thitherward our persons,<br/>
			"Beati pauperes spiritu," voices<br/>
			Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02264">Ah me! how different are these entrances<br/>
			From the Infernal! for with anthems here<br/>
			One enters, and below with wild laments.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02265">We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,<br/>
			And it appeared to me by far more easy<br/>
			Than on the plain it had appeared before.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02266">Whence I: "My Master, say, what heavy thing<br/>
			Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly<br/>
			Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02267">He answered: "When the P's which have remained<br/>
			Still on thy face almost obliterate<br/>
			Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02268">Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,<br/>
			That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,<br/>
			But urging up will be to them delight."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02269">Then did I even as they do who are going<br/>
			With something on the head to them unknown,<br/>
			Unless the signs of others make them doubt,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02270">Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,<br/>
			And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office<br/>
			Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02271">And with the fingers of the right hand spread<br/>
			I found but six the letters, that had carved<br/>
			Upon my temples he who bore the keys;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02272">Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.</p>
			<p id="id02273" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XIII</p>
			<p id="id02274" style="margin-top: 2em">We were upon the summit of the stairs,<br/>
			Where for the second time is cut away<br/>
			The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02275">There in like manner doth a cornice bind<br/>
			The hill all round about, as does the first,<br/>
			Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02276">Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;<br/>
			So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,<br/>
			With but the livid colour of the stone.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02277">"If to inquire we wait for people here,"<br/>
			The Poet said, "I fear that peradventure<br/>
			Too much delay will our election have."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02278">Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,<br/>
			Made his right side the centre of his motion,<br/>
			And turned the left part of himself about.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02279">"O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter<br/>
			Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,"<br/>
			Said he, "as one within here should be led.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02280">Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;<br/>
			If other reason prompt not otherwise,<br/>
			Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02281">As much as here is counted for a mile,<br/>
			So much already there had we advanced<br/>
			In little time, by dint of ready will;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02282">And tow'rds us there were heard to fly, albeit<br/>
			They were not visible, spirits uttering<br/>
			Unto Love's table courteous invitations,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02283">The first voice that passed onward in its flight,<br/>
			"Vinum non habent," said in accents loud,<br/>
			And went reiterating it behind us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02284">And ere it wholly grew inaudible<br/>
			Because of distance, passed another, crying,<br/>
			"I am Orestes!" and it also stayed not.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02285">"O," said I, "Father, these, what voices are they?"<br/>
			And even as I asked, behold the third,<br/>
			Saying: "Love those from whom ye have had evil!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02286">And the good Master said: "This circle scourges<br/>
			The sin of envy, and on that account<br/>
			Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02287">The bridle of another sound shall be;<br/>
			I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,<br/>
			Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02288">But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,<br/>
			And people thou wilt see before us sitting,<br/>
			And each one close against the cliff is seated."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02289">Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;<br/>
			I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles<br/>
			Not from the colour of the stone diverse.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02290">And when we were a little farther onward,<br/>
			I heard a cry of, "Mary, pray for us!"<br/>
			A cry of, "Michael, Peter, and all Saints!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02291">I do not think there walketh still on earth<br/>
			A man so hard, that he would not be pierced<br/>
			With pity at what afterward I saw.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02292">For when I had approached so near to them<br/>
			That manifest to me their acts became,<br/>
			Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02293">Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,<br/>
			And one sustained the other with his shoulder,<br/>
			And all of them were by the bank sustained.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02294">Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,<br/>
			Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,<br/>
			And one upon another leans his head,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02295">So that in others pity soon may rise,<br/>
			Not only at the accent of their words,<br/>
			But at their aspect, which no less implores.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02296">And as unto the blind the sun comes not,<br/>
			So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,<br/>
			Heaven's light will not be bounteous of itself;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02297">For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,<br/>
			And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild<br/>
			Is done, because it will not quiet stay.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02298">To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,<br/>
			Seeing the others without being seen;<br/>
			Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02299">Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,<br/>
			And therefore waited not for my demand,<br/>
			But said: "Speak, and be brief, and to the point."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02300">I had Virgilius upon that side<br/>
			Of the embankment from which one may fall,<br/>
			Since by no border 'tis engarlanded;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02301">Upon the other side of me I had<br/>
			The shades devout, who through the horrible seam<br/>
			Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02302">To them I turned me, and, "O people, certain,"<br/>
			Began I, "of beholding the high light,<br/>
			Which your desire has solely in its care,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02303">So may grace speedily dissolve the scum<br/>
			Upon your consciences, that limpidly<br/>
			Through them descend the river of the mind,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02304">Tell me, for dear 'twill be to me and gracious,<br/>
			If any soul among you here is Latian,<br/>
			And 'twill perchance be good for him I learn it."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02305">"O brother mine, each one is citizen<br/>
			Of one true city; but thy meaning is,<br/>
			Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02306">By way of answer this I seemed to hear<br/>
			A little farther on than where I stood,<br/>
			Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02307">Among the rest I saw a shade that waited<br/>
			In aspect, and should any one ask how,<br/>
			Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02308">"Spirit," I said, "who stoopest to ascend,<br/>
			If thou art he who did reply to me,<br/>
			Make thyself known to me by place or name."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02309">"Sienese was I," it replied, "and with<br/>
			The others here recleanse my guilty life,<br/>
			Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02310">Sapient I was not, although I Sapia<br/>
			Was called, and I was at another's harm<br/>
			More happy far than at my own good fortune.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02311">And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,<br/>
			Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.<br/>
			The arc already of my years descending,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02312">My fellow-citizens near unto Colle<br/>
			Were joined in battle with their adversaries,<br/>
			And I was praying God for what he willed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02313">Routed were they, and turned into the bitter<br/>
			Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,<br/>
			A joy received unequalled by all others;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02314">So that I lifted upward my bold face<br/>
			Crying to God, 'Henceforth I fear thee not,'<br/>
			As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02315">Peace I desired with God at the extreme<br/>
			Of my existence, and as yet would not<br/>
			My debt have been by penitence discharged,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02316">Had it not been that in remembrance held me<br/>
			Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,<br/>
			Who out of charity was grieved for me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02317">But who art thou, that into our conditions<br/>
			Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound<br/>
			As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02318">"Mine eyes," I said, "will yet be here ta'en from me,<br/>
			But for short space; for small is the offence<br/>
			Committed by their being turned with envy.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02319">Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended<br/>
			My soul is, of the torment underneath,<br/>
			For even now the load down there weighs on me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02320">And she to me: "Who led thee, then, among us<br/>
			Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?"<br/>
			And I: "He who is with me, and speaks not;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02321">And living am I; therefore ask of me,<br/>
			Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move<br/>
			O'er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02322">"O, this is such a novel thing to hear,"<br/>
			She answered, "that great sign it is God loves thee;<br/>
			Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02323">And I implore, by what thou most desirest,<br/>
			If e'er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,<br/>
			Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02324">Them wilt thou see among that people vain<br/>
			Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there<br/>
			More hope than in discovering the Diana;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02325">But there still more the admirals will lose."</p>

			Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,<br/>
			And gently, so that he may speak, accost him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02329">Thus did two spirits, leaning tow'rds each other,<br/>

			Then held supine their faces to address me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02330">And said the one: "O soul, that, fastened still<br/>

			He who first spake, "thou speakest of the Arno."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02335">And said the other to him: "Why concealed<br/>

			<p id="id02336">And thus the shade that questioned was of this<br/>

			<p id="id02340">On which account have so transformed their nature<br/>

			Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,<br/>
			Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02401">That goodness infinite and ineffable<br/>
			Which is above there, runneth unto love,<br/>
			As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02402">So much it gives itself as it finds ardour,<br/>
			So that as far as charity extends,<br/>
			O'er it increases the eternal valour.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02403">And the more people thitherward aspire,<br/>
			More are there to love well, and more they love there,<br/>
			And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02404">And if my reasoning appease thee not,<br/>
			Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully<br/>
			Take from thee this and every other longing.<br/></p>

			As are the two already, the five wounds<br/>
			That close themselves again by being painful."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02406">Even as I wished to say, "Thou dost appease me,"<br/>
			I saw that I had reached another circle,<br/>
			So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02407">There it appeared to me that in a vision<br/>
			Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,<br/>
			And in a temple many persons saw;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02408">And at the door a woman, with the sweet<br/>
			Behaviour of a mother, saying: "Son,<br/>
			Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?<br/></p>
			<p id="id02409">Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself<br/>
			Were seeking for thee;"—and as here she ceased,<br/>
			That which appeared at first had disappeared.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02410">Then I beheld another with those waters<br/>
			Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever<br/>
			From great disdain of others it is born,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02411">And saying: "If of that city thou art lord,<br/>
			For whose name was such strife among the gods,<br/>
			And whence doth every science scintillate,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02412">Avenge thyself on those audacious arms<br/>
			That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;"<br/>
			And the lord seemed to me benign and mild<br/></p>
			<p id="id02413">To answer her with aspect temperate:<br/>
			"What shall we do to those who wish us ill,<br/>
			If he who loves us be by us condemned?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02414">Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,<br/>
			With stones a young man slaying, clamorously<br/>
			Still crying to each other, "Kill him! kill him!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02415">And him I saw bow down, because of death<br/>
			That weighed already on him, to the earth,<br/>
			But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02416">Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,<br/>
			That he would pardon those his persecutors,<br/>
			With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02417">Soon as my soul had outwardly returned<br/>
			To things external to it which are true,<br/>
			Did I my not false errors recognize.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02418">My Leader, who could see me bear myself<br/>
			Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,<br/>
			Exclaimed: "What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?<br/></p>
			<p id="id02419">But hast been coming more than half a league<br/>
			Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,<br/>
			In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02420">"O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,<br/>
			I'll tell thee," said I, "what appeared to me,<br/>
			When thus from me my legs were ta'en away."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02421">And he: "If thou shouldst have a hundred masks<br/>
			Upon thy face, from me would not be shut<br/>
			Thy cogitations, howsoever small.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02422">What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail<br/>
			To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,<br/>
			Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02423">I did not ask, 'What ails thee?' as he does<br/>
			Who only looketh with the eyes that see not<br/>
			When of the soul bereft the body lies,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02424">But asked it to give vigour to thy feet;<br/>
			Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow<br/>
			To use their wakefulness when it returns."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02425">We passed along, athwart the twilight peering<br/>
			Forward as far as ever eye could stretch<br/>
			Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02426">And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached<br/>
			In our direction, sombre as the night,<br/>
			Nor was there place to hide one's self therefrom.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02427">This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.</p>
			<p id="id02428" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XVI</p>
			<p id="id02429" style="margin-top: 2em">Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived<br/>

			<p id="id02430">Ne'er made unto my sight so thick a veil,<br/>
			As did that smoke which there enveloped us,<br/>

			So that all harmony appeared among them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02436">"Master," I said, "are spirits those I hear?"<br/>
			And he to me: "Thou apprehendest truly,<br/>
			And they the knot of anger go unloosing."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02437">"Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke<br/>
			And art discoursing of us even as though<br/>
			Thou didst by calends still divide the time?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02438">After this manner by a voice was spoken;<br/>
			Whereon my Master said: "Do thou reply,<br/>
			And ask if on this side the way go upward."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02439">And I: "O creature that dost cleanse thyself<br/>
			To return beautiful to Him who made thee,<br/>
			Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02440">"Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,"<br/>
			He answered; "and if smoke prevent our seeing,<br/>
			Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02441">Thereon began I: "With that swathing band<br/>
			Which death unwindeth am I going upward,<br/>
			And hither came I through the infernal anguish.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02442">And if God in his grace has me infolded,<br/>
			So that he wills that I behold his court<br/>
			By method wholly out of modern usage,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02443">Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,<br/>

			Thus he made answer, and subjoined: "I pray thee<br/>

			<p id="id02446">And I to him: "My faith I pledge to thee<br/>

			Still upward to the heavens, as if all things<br/>

			<p id="id02452">If this were so, in you would be destroyed<br/>

			In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,<br/>
			Afterwards conquers all, if well 'tis nurtured.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02455">To greater force and to a better nature,<br/>
			Though free, ye subject are, and that creates<br/>
			The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02456">Hence, if the present world doth go astray,<br/>
			In you the cause is, be it sought in you;<br/>
			And I therein will now be thy true spy.<br/></p>

			<p id="id02459">Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour;<br/>
			Is cheated by it, and runs after it,<br/>
			If guide or rein turn not aside its love.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02460">Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,<br/>
			Behoved a king to have, who at the least<br/>
			Of the true city should discern the tower.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02461">The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?<br/>
			No one; because the shepherd who precedes<br/>

			<p id="id02462">Wherefore the people that perceives its guide<br/>

			<p id="id02508">But still more openly to understand,<br/>
			Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather<br/>
			Some profitable fruit from our delay.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02509">Neither Creator nor a creature ever,<br/>

			And in the second moderates itself,<br/>
			It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02512">But when to ill it turns, and, with more care<br/>
			Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,<br/>
			'Gainst the Creator works his own creation.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02513">Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be<br/>

			<p id="id02514">Now inasmuch as never from the welfare<br/>
			Of its own subject can love turn its sight,<br/>
			From their own hatred all things are secure;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02515">And since we cannot think of any being<br/>
			Standing alone, nor from the First divided,<br/>
			Of hating Him is all desire cut off.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02516">Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,<br/>
			The evil that one loves is of one's neighbour,<br/>

			<p id="id02521">Each one confusedly a good conceives<br/>
			Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;<br/>
			Therefore to overtake it each one strives.<br/></p>

			"If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,<br/>
			Who up his stairs so far has guided you?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02686">And said my Teacher: "If thou note the marks<br/>
			Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces<br/>
			Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02687">But because she who spinneth day and night<br/>
			For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,<br/>
			Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02688">His soul, which is thy sister and my own,<br/>
			In coming upwards could not come alone,<br/>
			By reason that it sees not in our fashion.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02689">Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat<br/>
			Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him<br/>
			As far on as my school has power to lead.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02690">But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder<br/>
			Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together<br/>
			All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02691">In asking he so hit the very eye<br/>
			Of my desire, that merely with the hope<br/>
			My thirst became the less unsatisfied.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02692">"Naught is there," he began, "that without order<br/>
			May the religion of the mountain feel,<br/>
			Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02693">Free is it here from every permutation;<br/>
			What from itself heaven in itself receiveth<br/>
			Can be of this the cause, and naught beside;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02694">Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,<br/>
			Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls<br/>
			Than the short, little stairway of three steps.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02695">Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,<br/>
			Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,<br/>
			That often upon earth her region shifts;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02696">No arid vapour any farther rises<br/>
			Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,<br/>
			Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02697">Lower down perchance it trembles less or more,<br/>
			But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden<br/>
			I know not how, up here it never trembled.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02698">It trembles here, whenever any soul<br/>
			Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves<br/>
			To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02699">Of purity the will alone gives proof,<br/>
			Which, being wholly free to change its convent,<br/>
			Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02700">First it wills well; but the desire permits not,<br/>
			Which divine justice with the self-same will<br/>
			There was to sin, upon the torment sets.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02701">And I, who have been lying in this pain<br/>
			Five hundred years and more, but just now felt<br/>
			A free volition for a better seat.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02702">Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious<br/>
			Spirits along the mountain rendering praise<br/>
			Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02703">So said he to him; and since we enjoy<br/>
			As much in drinking as the thirst is great,<br/>
			I could not say how much it did me good.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02704">And the wise Leader: "Now I see the net<br/>
			That snares you here, and how ye are set free,<br/>
			Why the earth quakes, and wherefore ye rejoice.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02705">Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know;<br/>
			And why so many centuries thou hast here<br/>
			Been lying, let me gather from thy words."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02706">"In days when the good Titus, with the aid<br/>
			Of the supremest King, avenged the wounds<br/>

			Was I on earth," that spirit made reply,<br/>
			"Greatly renowned, but not with faith as yet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02708">My vocal spirit was so sweet, that Rome<br/>

			Unto the passion from which each springs forth,<br/>
			In the most truthful least the will they follow.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02715">I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;<br/>
			Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed<br/>
			Into mine eyes, where most expression dwells;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02716">And, "As thou well mayst consummate a labour<br/>
			So great," it said, "why did thy face just now<br/>
			Display to me the lightning of a smile?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02717">Now am I caught on this side and on that;<br/>
			One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me,<br/>
			Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02718">"Speak," said my Master, "and be not afraid<br/>
			Of speaking, but speak out, and say to him<br/>
			What he demands with such solicitude."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02719">Whence I: "Thou peradventure marvellest,<br/>
			O antique spirit, at the smile I gave;<br/>
			But I will have more wonder seize upon thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02720">This one, who guides on high these eyes of mine,<br/>
			Is that Virgilius, from whom thou didst learn<br/>
			To sing aloud of men and of the Gods.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02721">If other cause thou to my smile imputedst,<br/>
			Abandon it as false, and trust it was<br/>
			Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02722">Already he was stooping to embrace<br/>
			My Teacher's feet; but he said to him: "Brother,<br/>
			Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02723">And he uprising: "Now canst thou the sum<br/>
			Of love which warms me to thee comprehend,<br/>
			When this our vanity I disremember,<br/></p>

			Than he would do, for other people's sake.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02828">But tell me, if thou knowest, where is Piccarda;<br/>
			Tell me if any one of note I see<br/>
			Among this folk that gazes at me so."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02829">"My sister, who, 'twixt beautiful and good,<br/>
			I know not which was more, triumphs rejoicing<br/>
			Already in her crown on high Olympus."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02830">So said he first, and then: "'Tis not forbidden<br/>
			To name each other here, so milked away<br/>
			Is our resemblance by our dieting.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02831">This," pointing with his finger, "is Buonagiunta,<br/>
			Buonagiunta, of Lucca; and that face<br/>
			Beyond him there, more peaked than the others,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02832">Has held the holy Church within his arms;<br/>
			From Tours was he, and purges by his fasting<br/>
			Bolsena's eels and the Vernaccia wine."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02833">He named me many others one by one;<br/>
			And all contented seemed at being named,<br/>
			So that for this I saw not one dark look.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02834">I saw for hunger bite the empty air<br/>
			Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,<br/>
			Who with his crook had pastured many people.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02835">I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure<br/>
			Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,<br/>
			And he was one who ne'er felt satisfied.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02836">But as he does who scans, and then doth prize<br/>
			One more than others, did I him of Lucca,<br/>
			Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02837">He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca<br/>
			From that place heard I, where he felt the wound<br/>
			Of justice, that doth macerate them so.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02838">"O soul," I said, "that seemest so desirous<br/>
			To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,<br/>
			And with thy speech appease thyself and me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02839">"A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,"<br/>
			Began he, "who to thee shall pleasant make<br/>
			My city, howsoever men may blame it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02840">Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;<br/>
			If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,<br/>
			True things hereafter will declare it to thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02841">But say if him I here behold, who forth<br/>
			Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,<br/>
			'Ladies, that have intelligence of love?'"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02842">And I to him: "One am I, who, whenever<br/>
			Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure<br/>
			Which he within me dictates, singing go."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02843">"O brother, now I see," he said, "the knot<br/>
			Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held<br/>
			Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02844">I do perceive full clearly how your pens<br/>
			Go closely following after him who dictates,<br/>
			Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02845">And he who sets himself to go beyond,<br/>
			No difference sees from one style to another;"<br/>
			And as if satisfied, he held his peace.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02846">Even as the birds, that winter tow'rds the Nile,<br/>
			Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,<br/>
			Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02847">In such wise all the people who were there,<br/>
			Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,<br/>
			Both by their leanness and their wishes light.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02848">And as a man, who weary is with trotting,<br/>
			Lets his companions onward go, and walks,<br/>
			Until he vents the panting of his chest;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02849">So did Forese let the holy flock<br/>
			Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,<br/>
			"When will it be that I again shall see thee?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02850">"How long," I answered, "I may live, I know not;<br/>
			Yet my return will not so speedy be,<br/>
			But I shall sooner in desire arrive;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02851">Because the place where I was set to live<br/>
			From day to day of good is more depleted,<br/>
			And unto dismal ruin seems ordained."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02852">"Now go," he said, "for him most guilty of it<br/>
			At a beast's tail behold I dragged along<br/>
			Towards the valley where is no repentance.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02853">Faster at every step the beast is going,<br/>
			Increasing evermore until it smites him,<br/>
			And leaves the body vilely mutilated.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02854">Not long those wheels shall turn," and he uplifted<br/>
			His eyes to heaven, "ere shall be clear to thee<br/>
			That which my speech no farther can declare.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02855">Now stay behind; because the time so precious<br/>
			Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much<br/>
			By coming onward thus abreast with thee."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02856">As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop<br/>
			A cavalier from out a troop that ride,<br/>
			And seeks the honour of the first encounter,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02857">So he with greater strides departed from us;<br/>
			And on the road remained I with those two,<br/>
			Who were such mighty marshals of the world.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02858">And when before us he had gone so far<br/>
			Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants<br/>
			As was my understanding to his words,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02859">Appeared to me with laden and living boughs<br/>
			Another apple-tree, and not far distant,<br/>
			From having but just then turned thitherward.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02860">People I saw beneath it lift their hands,<br/>
			And cry I know not what towards the leaves,<br/>
			Like little children eager and deluded,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02861">Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,<br/>
			But, to make very keen their appetite,<br/>
			Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02862">Then they departed as if undeceived;<br/>
			And now we came unto the mighty tree<br/>
			Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02863">"Pass farther onward without drawing near;<br/>
			The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,<br/>
			And out of that one has this tree been raised."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02864">Thus said I know not who among the branches;<br/>
			Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself<br/>
			Went crowding forward on the side that rises.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02865">"Be mindful," said he, "of the accursed ones<br/>
			Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate<br/>
			Combated Theseus with their double breasts;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02866">And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,<br/>
			Whence Gideon would not have them for companions<br/>
			When he tow'rds Midian the hills descended."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02867">Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,<br/>
			On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,<br/>
			Followed forsooth by miserable gains;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02868">Then set at large upon the lonely road,<br/>
			A thousand steps and more we onward went,<br/>
			In contemplation, each without a word.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02869">"What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?"<br/>
			Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started<br/>
			As terrified and timid beasts are wont.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02870">I raised my head to see who this might be,<br/>
			And never in a furnace was there seen<br/>
			Metals or glass so lucent and so red<br/></p>
			<p id="id02871">As one I saw who said: "If it may please you<br/>
			To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;<br/>
			This way goes he who goeth after peace."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02872">His aspect had bereft me of my sight,<br/>
			So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,<br/>
			Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02873">And as, the harbinger of early dawn,<br/>
			The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,<br/>
			Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02874">So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst<br/>
			My front, and felt the moving of the plumes<br/>
			That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;<br/></p>
			<p id="id02875">And heard it said: "Blessed are they whom grace<br/>
			So much illumines, that the love of taste<br/>
			Excites not in their breasts too great desire,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02876">Hungering at all times so far as is just."</p>

			<p id="id02880">In this wise did we enter through the gap,<br/>

			<p id="id02970">Then, to give place perchance to one behind,<br/>

			<p id="id02978" style="margin-top: 2em">As when he vibrates forth his earliest rays,<br/>
			In regions where his Maker shed his blood,<br/>
			(The Ebro falling under lofty Libra,<br/></p>
			<p id="id02979">And waters in the Ganges burnt with noon,)<br/>
			So stood the Sun; hence was the day departing,<br/>
			When the glad Angel of God appeared to us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02980">Outside the flame he stood upon the verge,<br/>
			And chanted forth, "Beati mundo corde,"<br/>
			In voice by far more living than our own.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02981">Then: "No one farther goes, souls sanctified,<br/>

			<p id="id02982">When we were close beside him thus he said;<br/>

			<p id="id02983">Upon my clasped hands I straightened me,<br/>
			Scanning the fire, and vividly recalling<br/>
			The human bodies I had once seen burned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id02984">Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors,<br/>
			And unto me Virgilius said: "My son,<br/>

			And I still motionless, and 'gainst my conscience!<br/></p>
			<p id="id02989">Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,<br/>
			Somewhat disturbed he said: "Now look thou, Son,<br/>
			'Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02990">As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids<br/>

			<p id="id02991">Even thus, my obduracy being softened,<br/>
			I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name<br/>

			<p id="id02992">Whereat he wagged his head, and said: "How now?<br/>

			So without measure was the burning there!<br/></p>
			<p id="id02995">And my sweet Father, to encourage me,<br/>
			Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,<br/>
			Saying: "Her eyes I seem to see already!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id02996">A voice, that on the other side was singing,<br/>

			<p id="id02997">"Venite, benedicti Patris mei,"<br/>

			<p id="id02998">"The sun departs," it added, "and night cometh;<br/>
			Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps,<br/>
			So long as yet the west becomes not dark."<br/></p>
			<p id="id02999">Straight forward through the rock the path ascended<br/>
			In such a way that I cut off the rays<br/>
			Before me of the sun, that now was low.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03000">And of few stairs we yet had made assay,<br/>

			<p id="id03002">Each of us of a stair had made his bed;<br/>
			Because the nature of the mount took from us<br/>
			The power of climbing, more than the delight.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03003">Even as in ruminating passive grow<br/>
			The goats, who have been swift and venturesome<br/>
			Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03004">Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,<br/>
			Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff<br/>
			Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03005">And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,<br/>
			Passes the night beside his quiet flock,<br/>
			Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03006">Such at that hour were we, all three of us,<br/>
			I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,<br/>
			Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03007">Little could there be seen of things without;<br/>
			But through that little I beheld the stars<br/>
			More luminous and larger than their wont.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03008">Thus ruminating, and beholding these,<br/>
			Sleep seized upon me,—sleep, that oftentimes<br/>
			Before a deed is done has tidings of it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03009">It was the hour, I think, when from the East<br/>
			First on the mountain Citherea beamed,<br/>
			Who with the fire of love seems always burning;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03010">Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought<br/>
			I saw a lady walking in a meadow,<br/>
			Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03011">"Know whosoever may my name demand<br/>
			That I am Leah, and go moving round<br/>
			My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03012">To please me at the mirror, here I deck me,<br/>
			But never does my sister Rachel leave<br/>
			Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03013">To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,<br/>
			As I am to adorn me with my hands;<br/>
			Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03014">And now before the antelucan splendours<br/>
			That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,<br/>
			As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03015">The darkness fled away on every side,<br/>
			And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,<br/>
			Seeing already the great Masters risen.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03016">"That apple sweet, which through so many branches<br/>
			The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,<br/>
			To-day shall put in peace thy hungerings."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03017">Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words<br/>
			As these made use; and never were there guerdons<br/>
			That could in pleasantness compare with these.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03018">Such longing upon longing came upon me<br/>
			To be above, that at each step thereafter<br/>
			For flight I felt in me the pinions growing.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03019">When underneath us was the stairway all<br/>
			Run o'er, and we were on the highest step,<br/>
			Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03020">And said: "The temporal fire and the eternal,<br/>

			Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03022">Behold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead;<br/>
			Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs<br/>
			Which of itself alone this land produces.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03023">Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes<br/>
			Which weeping caused me to come unto thee,<br/>
			Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03024">Expect no more or word or sign from me;<br/>
			Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,<br/>
			And error were it not to do its bidding;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03025">Thee o'er thyself I therefore crown and mitre!"</p>

			<p id="id03028">Withouten more delay I left the bank,<br/>
			Taking the level country slowly, slowly<br/>
			Over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03029">A softly-breathing air, that no mutation<br/>
			Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me<br/>
			No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03030">Whereat the branches, lightly tremulous,<br/>
			Did all of them bow downward toward that side<br/>
			Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mountain;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03031">Yet not from their upright direction swayed,<br/>
			So that the little birds upon their tops<br/>
			Should leave the practice of each art of theirs;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03032">But with full ravishment the hours of prime,<br/>
			Singing, received they in the midst of leaves,<br/>

			Into the ancient wood so far, that I<br/>
			Could not perceive where I had entered it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03035">And lo! my further course a stream cut off,<br/>
			Which tow'rd the left hand with its little waves<br/>
			Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03036">All waters that on earth most limpid are<br/>
			Would seem to have within themselves some mixture<br/>
			Compared with that which nothing doth conceal,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03037">Although it moves on with a brown, brown current<br/>
			Under the shade perpetual, that never<br/>
			Ray of the sun lets in, nor of the moon.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03038">With feet I stayed, and with mine eyes I passed<br/>
			Beyond the rivulet, to look upon<br/>
			The great variety of the fresh may.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03039">And there appeared to me (even as appears<br/>
			Suddenly something that doth turn aside<br/>
			Through very wonder every other thought)<br/></p>
			<p id="id03040">A lady all alone, who went along<br/>
			Singing and culling floweret after floweret,<br/>
			With which her pathway was all painted over.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03041">"Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love<br/>
			Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,<br/>
			Which the heart's witnesses are wont to be,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03042">May the desire come unto thee to draw<br/>
			Near to this river's bank," I said to her,<br/>
			"So much that I might hear what thou art singing.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03043">Thou makest me remember where and what<br/>
			Proserpina that moment was when lost<br/>
			Her mother her, and she herself the Spring."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03044">As turns herself, with feet together pressed<br/>
			And to the ground, a lady who is dancing,<br/>
			And hardly puts one foot before the other,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03045">On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets<br/>
			She turned towards me, not in other wise<br/>
			Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03046">And my entreaties made to be content,<br/>
			So near approaching, that the dulcet sound<br/>
			Came unto me together with its meaning<br/></p>
			<p id="id03047">As soon as she was where the grasses are.<br/>
			Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,<br/>
			To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03048">I do not think there shone so great a light<br/>
			Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed<br/>
			By her own son, beyond his usual custom!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03049">Erect upon the other bank she smiled,<br/>
			Bearing full many colours in her hands,<br/>
			Which that high land produces without seed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03050">Apart three paces did the river make us;<br/>
			But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across,<br/>
			(A curb still to all human arrogance,)<br/></p>
			<p id="id03051">More hatred from Leander did not suffer<br/>
			For rolling between Sestos and Abydos,<br/>
			Than that from me, because it oped not then.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03052">"Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,"<br/>
			Began she, "peradventure, in this place<br/>
			Elect to human nature for its nest,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03053">Some apprehension keeps you marvelling;<br/>
			But the psalm 'Delectasti' giveth light<br/>
			Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03054">And thou who foremost art, and didst entreat me,<br/>
			Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready<br/>
			To all thy questionings, as far as needful."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03055">"The water," said I, "and the forest's sound,<br/>
			Are combating within me my new faith<br/>
			In something which I heard opposed to this."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03056">Whence she: "I will relate how from its cause<br/>
			Proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder,<br/>
			And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03057">The Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting,<br/>
			Created man good, and this goodly place<br/>
			Gave him as hansel of eternal peace.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03058">By his default short while he sojourned here;<br/>
			By his default to weeping and to toil<br/>
			He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03059">That the disturbance which below is made<br/>
			By exhalations of the land and water,<br/>
			(Which far as may be follow after heat,)<br/></p>
			<p id="id03060">Might not upon mankind wage any war,<br/>
			This mount ascended tow'rds the heaven so high,<br/>
			And is exempt, from there where it is locked.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03061">Now since the universal atmosphere<br/>
			Turns in a circuit with the primal motion<br/>
			Unless the circle is broken on some side,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03062">Upon this height, that all is disengaged<br/>
			In living ether, doth this motion strike<br/>
			And make the forest sound, for it is dense;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03063">And so much power the stricken plant possesses<br/>
			That with its virtue it impregns the air,<br/>
			And this, revolving, scatters it around;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03064">And yonder earth, according as 'tis worthy<br/>
			In self or in its clime, conceives and bears<br/>
			Of divers qualities the divers trees;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03065">It should not seem a marvel then on earth,<br/>
			This being heard, whenever any plant<br/>
			Without seed manifest there taketh root.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03066">And thou must know, this holy table-land<br/>
			In which thou art is full of every seed,<br/>
			And fruit has in it never gathered there.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03067">The water which thou seest springs not from vein<br/>
			Restored by vapour that the cold condenses,<br/>
			Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03068">But issues from a fountain safe and certain,<br/>
			Which by the will of God as much regains<br/>
			As it discharges, open on two sides.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03069">Upon this side with virtue it descends,<br/>
			Which takes away all memory of sin;<br/>
			On that, of every good deed done restores it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03070">Here Lethe, as upon the other side<br/>
			Eunoe, it is called; and worketh not<br/>
			If first on either side it be not tasted.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03071">This every other savour doth transcend;<br/>
			And notwithstanding slaked so far may be<br/>
			Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03072">I'll give thee a corollary still in grace,<br/>
			Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear<br/>
			If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03073">Those who in ancient times have feigned in song<br/>
			The Age of Gold and its felicity,<br/>
			Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03074">Here was the human race in innocence;<br/>
			Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;<br/>
			This is the nectar of which each one speaks."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03075">Then backward did I turn me wholly round<br/>
			Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile<br/>
			They had been listening to these closing words;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03076">Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes.</p>
			<p id="id03077" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXIX</p>
			<p id="id03078" style="margin-top: 2em">Singing like unto an enamoured lady<br/>
			She, with the ending of her words, continued:<br/>
			"Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03079">And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone<br/>
			Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous<br/>
			One to avoid and one to see the sun,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03080">She then against the stream moved onward, going<br/>
			Along the bank, and I abreast of her,<br/>
			Her little steps with little steps attending.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03081">Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,<br/>
			When equally the margins gave a turn,<br/>
			In such a way, that to the East I faced.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03082">Nor even thus our way continued far<br/>
			Before the lady wholly turned herself<br/>
			Unto me, saying, "Brother, look and listen!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03083">And lo! a sudden lustre ran across<br/>
			On every side athwart the spacious forest,<br/>
			Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03084">But since the lightning ceases as it comes,<br/>
			And that continuing brightened more and more,<br/>
			Within my thought I said, "What thing is this?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03085">And a delicious melody there ran<br/>
			Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal<br/>
			Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03086">For there where earth and heaven obedient were,<br/>
			The woman only, and but just created,<br/>
			Could not endure to stay 'neath any veil;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03087">Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,<br/>

			Ineffable, and for a longer time.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03088">While 'mid such manifold first-fruits I walked<br/>
			Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,<br/>
			And still solicitous of more delights,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03089">In front of us like an enkindled fire<br/>
			Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,<br/>
			And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03090">O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,<br/>
			Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,<br/>

			<p id="id03091">Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,<br/>
			And with her choir Urania must assist me,<br/>
			To put in verse things difficult to think.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03092">A little farther on, seven trees of gold<br/>
			In semblance the long space still intervening<br/>
			Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03093">But when I had approached so near to them<br/>
			The common object, which the sense deceives,<br/>
			Lost not by distance any of its marks,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03094">The faculty that lends discourse to reason<br/>
			Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,<br/>
			And in the voices of the song "Hosanna!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03095">Above them flamed the harness beautiful,<br/>
			Far brighter than the moon in the serene<br/>
			Of midnight, at the middle of her month.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03096">I turned me round, with admiration filled,<br/>
			To good Virgilius, and he answered me<br/>
			With visage no less full of wonderment.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03097">Then back I turned my face to those high things,<br/>
			Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,<br/>
			They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03098">The lady chid me: "Why dost thou burn only<br/>
			So with affection for the living lights,<br/>
			And dost not look at what comes after them?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03099">Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,<br/>
			Coming behind them, garmented in white,<br/>
			And such a whiteness never was on earth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03100">The water on my left flank was resplendent,<br/>
			And back to me reflected my left side,<br/>
			E'en as a mirror, if I looked therein.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03101">When I upon my margin had such post<br/>
			That nothing but the stream divided us,<br/>

			With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours<br/>
			Whence the sun's bow is made, and Delia's girdle.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03104">These standards to the rearward longer were<br/>
			Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,<br/>
			Ten paces were the outermost apart.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03105">Under so fair a heaven as I describe<br/>
			The four and twenty Elders, two by two,<br/>
			Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03106">They all of them were singing: "Blessed thou<br/>

			<p id="id03107">After the flowers and other tender grasses<br/>
			In front of me upon the other margin<br/>
			Were disencumbered of that race elect,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03108">Even as in heaven star followeth after star,<br/>
			There came close after them four animals,<br/>
			Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03109">Plumed with six wings was every one of them,<br/>

			Between the middle list and three and three,<br/>
			So that he injured none by cleaving it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03115">So high they rose that they were lost to sight;<br/>

			Came onward dancing; one so very red<br/>
			That in the fire she hardly had been noted.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03119">The second was as if her flesh and bones<br/>
			Had all been fashioned out of emerald;<br/>
			The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03120">And now they seemed conducted by the white,<br/>
			Now by the red, and from the song of her<br/>
			The others took their step, or slow or swift.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03121">Upon the left hand four made holiday<br/>

			<p id="id03122">In rear of all the group here treated of<br/>
			Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,<br/>

			<p id="id03123">One showed himself as one of the disciples<br/>

			And behind all an aged man alone<br/>
			Walking in sleep with countenance acute.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03126">And like the foremost company these seven<br/>
			Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce<br/>
			No garland round about the head they wore,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03127">But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;<br/>
			At little distance would the sight have sworn<br/>
			That all were in a flame above their brows.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03128">And when the car was opposite to me<br/>

			<p id="id03153">Although the veil, that from her head descended,<br/>

			Did not permit her to appear distinctly,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03154">In attitude still royally majestic<br/>

			<p id="id03157">As to the son the mother seems superb,<br/>

			<p id="id03158">Silent became she, and the Angels sang<br/>
			Suddenly, "In te, Domine, speravi:"<br/>
			But beyond 'pedes meos' did not pass.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03159">Even as the snow among the living rafters<br/>

			After the music of the eternal spheres.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03162">But when I heard in their sweet melodies<br/>
			Compassion for me, more than had they said,<br/>
			"O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03163">The ice, that was about my heart congealed,<br/>
			To air and water changed, and in my anguish<br/>
			Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03164">She, on the right-hand border of the car<br/>
			Still firmly standing, to those holy beings<br/>
			Thus her discourse directed afterwards:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03165">"Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,<br/>
			So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you<br/>
			One step the ages make upon their path;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03166">Therefore my answer is with greater care,<br/>
			That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,<br/>
			So that the sin and dole be of one measure.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03167">Not only by the work of those great wheels,<br/>
			That destine every seed unto some end,<br/>
			According as the stars are in conjunction,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03168">But by the largess of celestial graces,<br/>
			Which have such lofty vapours for their rain<br/>
			That near to them our sight approaches not,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03169">Such had this man become in his new life<br/>
			Potentially, that every righteous habit<br/>
			Would have made admirable proof in him;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03170">But so much more malignant and more savage<br/>
			Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,<br/>
			The more good earthly vigour it possesses.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03171">Some time did I sustain him with my look;<br/>
			Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,<br/>
			I led him with me turned in the right way.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03172">As soon as ever of my second age<br/>
			I was upon the threshold and changed life,<br/>
			Himself from me he took and gave to others.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03173">When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,<br/>
			And beauty and virtue were in me increased,<br/>
			I was to him less dear and less delightful;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03174">And into ways untrue he turned his steps,<br/>
			Pursuing the false images of good,<br/>
			That never any promises fulfil;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03175">Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,<br/>
			By means of which in dreams and otherwise<br/>
			I called him back, so little did he heed them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03176">So low he fell, that all appliances<br/>
			For his salvation were already short,<br/>
			Save showing him the people of perdition.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03177">For this I visited the gates of death,<br/>
			And unto him, who so far up has led him,<br/>
			My intercessions were with weeping borne.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03178">God's lofty fiat would be violated,<br/>
			If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands<br/>
			Should tasted be, withouten any scot<br/></p>
			<p id="id03179">Of penitence, that gushes forth in tears."</p>

			<p id="id03181" style="margin-top: 2em">"O thou who art beyond the sacred river,"<br/>
			Turning to me the point of her discourse,<br/>
			That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03182">She recommenced, continuing without pause,<br/>
			"Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,<br/>
			Thy own confession needs must be conjoined."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03183">My faculties were in so great confusion,<br/>
			That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct<br/>
			Than by its organs it was set at large.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03184">Awhile she waited; then she said: "What thinkest?<br/>
			Answer me; for the mournful memories<br/>
			In thee not yet are by the waters injured."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03185">Confusion and dismay together mingled<br/>
			Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight<br/>
			Was needful to the understanding of it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03186">Even as a cross-bow breaks, when 'tis discharged<br/>
			Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,<br/>
			And with less force the arrow hits the mark,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03187">So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,<br/>
			Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,<br/>
			And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03188">Whence she to me: "In those desires of mine<br/>
			Which led thee to the loving of that good,<br/>
			Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03189">What trenches lying traverse or what chains<br/>
			Didst thou discover, that of passing onward<br/>
			Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?<br/></p>
			<p id="id03190">And what allurements or what vantages<br/>
			Upon the forehead of the others showed,<br/>
			That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03191">After the heaving of a bitter sigh,<br/>
			Hardly had I the voice to make response,<br/>
			And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03192">Weeping I said: "The things that present were<br/>
			With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,<br/>
			Soon as your countenance concealed itself."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03193">And she: "Shouldst thou be silent, or deny<br/>
			What thou confessest, not less manifest<br/>
			Would be thy fault, by such a Judge 'tis known.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03194">But when from one's own cheeks comes bursting forth<br/>
			The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal<br/>
			Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03195">But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame<br/>
			For thy transgression, and another time<br/>
			Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03196">Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;<br/>
			So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way<br/>
			My buried flesh should have directed thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03197">Never to thee presented art or nature<br/>
			Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein<br/>
			I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03198">And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee<br/>
			By reason of my death, what mortal thing<br/>
			Should then have drawn thee into its desire?<br/></p>
			<p id="id03199">Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft<br/>
			Of things fallacious to have risen up<br/>
			To follow me, who was no longer such.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03200">Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward<br/>
			To wait for further blows, or little girl,<br/>
			Or other vanity of such brief use.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03201">The callow birdlet waits for two or three,<br/>
			But to the eyes of those already fledged,<br/>
			In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03202">Even as children silent in their shame<br/>
			Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,<br/>
			And conscious of their fault, and penitent;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03203">So was I standing; and she said: "If thou<br/>
			In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard<br/>
			And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03204">With less resistance is a robust holm<br/>
			Uprooted, either by a native wind<br/>
			Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03205">Than I upraised at her command my chin;<br/>
			And when she by the beard the face demanded,<br/>
			Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03206">And as my countenance was lifted up,<br/>
			Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful<br/>
			Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03207">And, still but little reassured, mine eyes<br/>
			Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,<br/>
			That is one person only in two natures.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03208">Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,<br/>
			She seemed to me far more her ancient self<br/>
			To excel, than others here, when she was here.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03209">So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,<br/>
			That of all other things the one which turned me<br/>
			Most to its love became the most my foe.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03210">Such self-conviction stung me at the heart<br/>
			O'erpowered I fell, and what I then became<br/>
			She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03211">Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,<br/>
			The lady I had found alone, above me<br/>
			I saw, and she was saying, "Hold me, hold me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03212">Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,<br/>
			And, dragging me behind her, she was moving<br/>
			Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03213">When I was near unto the blessed shore,<br/>
			"Asperges me," I heard so sweetly sung,<br/>
			Remember it I cannot, much less write it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03214">The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,<br/>
			Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,<br/>
			Where I was forced to swallow of the water.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03215">Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought<br/>
			Into the dance of the four beautiful,<br/>
			And each one with her arm did cover me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03216">'We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;<br/>
			Ere Beatrice descended to the world,<br/>

			Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine<br/>
			The three beyond, who more profoundly look.'<br/></p>
			<p id="id03218">Thus singing they began; and afterwards<br/>
			Unto the Griffin's breast they led me with them,<br/>
			Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03219">"See that thou dost not spare thine eyes," they said;<br/>
			"Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,<br/>

			<p id="id03220">A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,<br/>
			Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,<br/>
			That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03221">As in a glass the sun, not otherwise<br/>

			My soul was tasting of the food, that while<br/>
			It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03224">Themselves revealing of the highest rank<br/>

			<p id="id03225">"Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,"<br/>
			Such was their song, "unto thy faithful one,<br/>

			But so that not a feather of him fluttered.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03240">The lady fair who drew me through the ford<br/>

			Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,<br/>
			And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03256">Peter and John and James conducted were,<br/>
			And, overcome, recovered at the word<br/>
			By which still greater slumbers have been broken,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03257">And saw their school diminished by the loss<br/>
			Not only of Elias, but of Moses,<br/>
			And the apparel of their Master changed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03258">So I revived, and saw that piteous one<br/>
			Above me standing, who had been conductress<br/>
			Aforetime of my steps beside the river,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03259">And all in doubt I said, "Where's Beatrice?"<br/>
			And she: "Behold her seated underneath<br/>
			The leafage new, upon the root of it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03260">Behold the company that circles her;<br/>
			The rest behind the Griffin are ascending<br/>
			With more melodious song, and more profound."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03261">And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,<br/>
			Because already in my sight was she<br/>
			Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03262">Alone she sat upon the very earth,<br/>
			Left there as guardian of the chariot<br/>
			Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03263">Encircling her, a cloister made themselves<br/>
			The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands<br/>
			Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03264">"Short while shalt thou be here a forester,<br/>
			And thou shalt be with me for evermore<br/>
			A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03265">Therefore, for that world's good which liveth ill,<br/>
			Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,<br/>
			Having returned to earth, take heed thou write."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03266">Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet<br/>
			Of her commandments all devoted was,<br/>
			My mind and eyes directed where she willed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03267">Never descended with so swift a motion<br/>
			Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining<br/>
			From out the region which is most remote,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03268">As I beheld the bird of Jove descend<br/>
			Down through the tree, rending away the bark,<br/>
			As well as blossoms and the foliage new,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03269">And he with all his might the chariot smote,<br/>
			Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest<br/>
			Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03270">Thereafter saw I leap into the body<br/>
			Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,<br/>
			That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03271">But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,<br/>
			My Lady put him to as swift a flight<br/>
			As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03272">Then by the way that it before had come,<br/>
			Into the chariot's chest I saw the Eagle<br/>
			Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03273">And such as issues from a heart that mourns,<br/>
			A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:<br/>
			"My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03274">Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between<br/>
			Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,<br/>
			Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03275">And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,<br/>
			Drawing unto himself his tail malign,<br/>
			Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03276">That which remained behind, even as with grass<br/>
			A fertile region, with the feathers, offered<br/>
			Perhaps with pure intention and benign,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03277">Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed<br/>
			The pole and both the wheels so speedily,<br/>
			A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03278">Transfigured thus the holy edifice<br/>
			Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,<br/>
			Three on the pole and one at either corner.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03279">The first were horned like oxen; but the four<br/>
			Had but a single horn upon the forehead;<br/>
			A monster such had never yet been seen!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03280">Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,<br/>
			Seated upon it, there appeared to me<br/>
			A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03281">And, as if not to have her taken from him,<br/>
			Upright beside her I beheld a giant;<br/>
			And ever and anon they kissed each other.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03282">But because she her wanton, roving eye<br/>
			Turned upon me, her angry paramour<br/>
			Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03283">Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,<br/>
			He loosed the monster, and across the forest<br/>
			Dragged it so far, he made of that alone<br/></p>
			<p id="id03284">A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.</p>
			<p id="id03285" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXXIII</p>
			<p id="id03286" style="margin-top: 2em">"Deus venerunt gentes," alternating<br/>
			Now three, now four, melodious psalmody<br/>
			The maidens in the midst of tears began;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03287">And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,<br/>
			Listened to them with such a countenance,<br/>
			That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03288">But when the other virgins place had given<br/>
			For her to speak, uprisen to her feet<br/>
			With colour as of fire, she made response:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03289">"'Modicum, et non videbitis me;<br/>
			Et iterum,' my sisters predilect,<br/>
			'Modicum, et vos videbitis me.'"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03290">Then all the seven in front of her she placed;<br/>
			And after her, by beckoning only, moved<br/>
			Me and the lady and the sage who stayed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03291">So she moved onward; and I do not think<br/>
			That her tenth step was placed upon the ground,<br/>
			When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03292">And with a tranquil aspect, "Come more quickly,"<br/>
			To me she said, "that, if I speak with thee,<br/>
			To listen to me thou mayst be well placed."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03293">As soon as I was with her as I should be,<br/>
			She said to me: "Why, brother, dost thou not<br/>
			Venture to question now, in coming with me?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03294">As unto those who are too reverential,<br/>
			Speaking in presence of superiors,<br/>
			Who drag no living utterance to their teeth,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03295">It me befell, that without perfect sound<br/>
			Began I: "My necessity, Madonna,<br/>
			You know, and that which thereunto is good."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03296">And she to me: "Of fear and bashfulness<br/>
			Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself,<br/>
			So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03297">Know that the vessel which the serpent broke<br/>
			Was, and is not; but let him who is guilty<br/>
			Think that God's vengeance does not fear a sop.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03298">Without an heir shall not for ever be<br/>
			The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car,<br/>
			Whence it became a monster, then a prey;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03299">For verily I see, and hence narrate it,<br/>
			The stars already near to bring the time,<br/>
			From every hindrance safe, and every bar,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03300">Within which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five,<br/>
			One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman<br/>
			And that same giant who is sinning with her.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03301">And peradventure my dark utterance,<br/>
			Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee,<br/>
			Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03302">But soon the facts shall be the Naiades<br/>
			Who shall this difficult enigma solve,<br/>
			Without destruction of the flocks and harvests.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03303">Note thou; and even as by me are uttered<br/>
			These words, so teach them unto those who live<br/>
			That life which is a running unto death;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03304">And bear in mind, whene'er thou writest them,<br/>
			Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant,<br/>
			That twice already has been pillaged here.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03305">Whoever pillages or shatters it,<br/>
			With blasphemy of deed offendeth God,<br/>
			Who made it holy for his use alone.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03306">For biting that, in pain and in desire<br/>
			Five thousand years and more the first-born soul<br/>
			Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03307">Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not<br/>
			For special reason so pre-eminent<br/>
			In height, and so inverted in its summit.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03308">And if thy vain imaginings had not been<br/>
			Water of Elsa round about thy mind,<br/>
			And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03309">Thou by so many circumstances only<br/>
			The justice of the interdict of God<br/>
			Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03310">But since I see thee in thine intellect<br/>
			Converted into stone and stained with sin,<br/>
			So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03311">I will too, if not written, at least painted,<br/>
			Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason<br/>
			That cinct with palm the pilgrim's staff is borne."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03312">And I: "As by a signet is the wax<br/>
			Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,<br/>
			My brain is now imprinted by yourself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03313">But wherefore so beyond my power of sight<br/>
			Soars your desirable discourse, that aye<br/>
			The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03314">"That thou mayst recognize," she said, "the school<br/>
			Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far<br/>
			Its doctrine follows after my discourse,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03315">And mayst behold your path from the divine<br/>
			Distant as far as separated is<br/>
			From earth the heaven that highest hastens on."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03316">Whence her I answered: "I do not remember<br/>
			That ever I estranged myself from you,<br/>
			Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03317">"And if thou art not able to remember,"<br/>
			Smiling she answered, "recollect thee now<br/>
			That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03318">And if from smoke a fire may be inferred,<br/>
			Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates<br/>
			Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03319">Truly from this time forward shall my words<br/>
			Be naked, so far as it is befitting<br/>
			To lay them open unto thy rude gaze."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03320">And more coruscant and with slower steps<br/>
			The sun was holding the meridian circle,<br/>
			Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there<br/></p>
			<p id="id03321">When halted (as he cometh to a halt,<br/>
			Who goes before a squadron as its escort,<br/>
			If something new he find upon his way)<br/></p>
			<p id="id03322">The ladies seven at a dark shadow's edge,<br/>
			Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,<br/>
			The Alp upon its frigid border wears.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03323">In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates<br/>
			Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,<br/>
			And slowly part, like friends, from one another.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03324">"O light, O glory of the human race!<br/>
			What stream is this which here unfolds itself<br/>
			From out one source, and from itself withdraws?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03325">For such a prayer, 'twas said unto me, "Pray<br/>
			Matilda that she tell thee;" and here answered,<br/>
			As one does who doth free himself from blame,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03326">The beautiful lady: "This and other things<br/>
			Were told to him by me; and sure I am<br/>
			The water of Lethe has not hid them from him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03327">And Beatrice: "Perhaps a greater care,<br/>
			Which oftentimes our memory takes away,<br/>
			Has made the vision of his mind obscure.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03328">But Eunoe behold, that yonder rises;<br/>
			Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,<br/>
			Revive again the half-dead virtue in him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03329">Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,<br/>
			But makes its own will of another's will<br/>
			As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03330">Even so, when she had taken hold of me,<br/>
			The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius<br/>
			Said, in her womanly manner, "Come with him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03331">If, Reader, I possessed a longer space<br/>
			For writing it, I yet would sing in part<br/>
			Of the sweet draught that ne'er would satiate me;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03332">But inasmuch as full are all the leaves<br/>
			Made ready for this second canticle,<br/>
			The curb of art no farther lets me go.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03333">From the most holy water I returned<br/>
			Regenerate, in the manner of new trees<br/>
			That are renewed with a new foliage,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03334">Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars.</p>
