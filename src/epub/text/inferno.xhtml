			<h2>Inferno</h2>
			<p id="id00062" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto I</p>
			<p id="id00063" style="margin-top: 2em">Midway upon the journey of our life<br/>
			I found myself within a forest dark,<br/>
			For the straightforward pathway had been lost.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00064">Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say<br/>
			What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,<br/>
			Which in the very thought renews the fear.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00065">So bitter is it, death is little more;<br/>
			But of the good to treat, which there I found,<br/>
			Speak will I of the other things I saw there.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00066">I cannot well repeat how there I entered,<br/>
			So full was I of slumber at the moment<br/>
			In which I had abandoned the true way.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00067">But after I had reached a mountain's foot,<br/>
			At that point where the valley terminated,<br/>
			Which had with consternation pierced my heart,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00068">Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,<br/>
			Vested already with that planet's rays<br/>
			Which leadeth others right by every road.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00069">Then was the fear a little quieted<br/>
			That in my heart's lake had endured throughout<br/>
			The night, which I had passed so piteously.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00070">And even as he, who, with distressful breath,<br/>
			Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,<br/>
			Turns to the water perilous and gazes;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00071">So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,<br/>
			Turn itself back to re-behold the pass<br/>
			Which never yet a living person left.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00072">After my weary body I had rested,<br/>
			The way resumed I on the desert slope,<br/>
			So that the firm foot ever was the lower.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00073">And lo! almost where the ascent began,<br/>
			A panther light and swift exceedingly,<br/>
			Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00074">And never moved she from before my face,<br/>
			Nay, rather did impede so much my way,<br/>
			That many times I to return had turned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00075">The time was the beginning of the morning,<br/>
			And up the sun was mounting with those stars<br/>
			That with him were, what time the Love Divine<br/></p>
			<p id="id00076">At first in motion set those beauteous things;<br/>
			So were to me occasion of good hope,<br/>
			The variegated skin of that wild beast,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00077">The hour of time, and the delicious season;<br/>
			But not so much, that did not give me fear<br/>
			A lion's aspect which appeared to me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00078">He seemed as if against me he were coming<br/>
			With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,<br/>
			So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00079">And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings<br/>
			Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,<br/>
			And many folk has caused to live forlorn!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00080">She brought upon me so much heaviness,<br/>
			With the affright that from her aspect came,<br/>
			That I the hope relinquished of the height.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00081">And as he is who willingly acquires,<br/>
			And the time comes that causes him to lose,<br/>
			Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00082">E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,<br/>
			Which, coming on against me by degrees<br/>
			Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00083">While I was rushing downward to the lowland,<br/>
			Before mine eyes did one present himself,<br/>
			Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00084">When I beheld him in the desert vast,<br/>
			"Have pity on me," unto him I cried,<br/>
			"Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00085">He answered me: "Not man; man once I was,<br/>
			And both my parents were of Lombardy,<br/>
			And Mantuans by country both of them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00086">'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,<br/>
			And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,<br/>
			During the time of false and lying gods.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00087">A poet was I, and I sang that just<br/>
			Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,<br/>
			After that Ilion the superb was burned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00088">But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?<br/>
			Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,<br/>
			Which is the source and cause of every joy?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00089">"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain<br/>
			Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?"<br/>
			I made response to him with bashful forehead.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00090">"O, of the other poets honour and light,<br/>
			Avail me the long study and great love<br/>
			That have impelled me to explore thy volume!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00091">Thou art my master, and my author thou,<br/>
			Thou art alone the one from whom I took<br/>
			The beautiful style that has done honour to me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00092">Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;<br/>
			Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,<br/>
			For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00093">"Thee it behoves to take another road,"<br/>
			Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,<br/>
			"If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00094">Because this beast, at which thou criest out,<br/>
			Suffers not any one to pass her way,<br/>
			But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00095">And has a nature so malign and ruthless,<br/>
			That never doth she glut her greedy will,<br/>
			And after food is hungrier than before.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00096">Many the animals with whom she weds,<br/>
			And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound<br/>
			Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00097">He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,<br/>
			But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;<br/>
			'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00098">Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,<br/>
			On whose account the maid Camilla died,<br/>
			Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00099">Through every city shall he hunt her down,<br/>
			Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,<br/>
			There from whence envy first did let her loose.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00100">Therefore I think and judge it for thy best<br/>
			Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,<br/>
			And lead thee hence through the eternal place,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00101">Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,<br/>
			Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,<br/>
			Who cry out each one for the second death;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00102">And thou shalt see those who contented are<br/>
			Within the fire, because they hope to come,<br/>
			Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00103">To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,<br/>
			A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;<br/>
			With her at my departure I will leave thee;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00104">Because that Emperor, who reigns above,<br/>
			In that I was rebellious to his law,<br/>
			Wills that through me none come into his city.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00105">He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;<br/>
			There is his city and his lofty throne;<br/>
			O happy he whom thereto he elects!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00106">And I to him: "Poet, I thee entreat,<br/>
			By that same God whom thou didst never know,<br/>
			So that I may escape this woe and worse,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00107">Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,<br/>
			That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,<br/>
			And those thou makest so disconsolate."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00108">Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</p>
			<p id="id00109" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto II</p>
			<p id="id00110" style="margin-top: 2em">Day was departing, and the embrowned air<br/>
			Released the animals that are on earth<br/>
			From their fatigues; and I the only one<br/></p>
			<p id="id00111">Made myself ready to sustain the war,<br/>
			Both of the way and likewise of the woe,<br/>
			Which memory that errs not shall retrace.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00112">O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!<br/>
			O memory, that didst write down what I saw,<br/>
			Here thy nobility shall be manifest!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00113">And I began: "Poet, who guidest me,<br/>
			Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,<br/>
			Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00114">Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,<br/>
			While yet corruptible, unto the world<br/>
			Immortal went, and was there bodily.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00115">But if the adversary of all evil<br/>
			Was courteous, thinking of the high effect<br/>
			That issue would from him, and who, and what,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00116">To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;<br/>
			For he was of great Rome, and of her empire<br/>
			In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00117">The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,<br/>
			Were stablished as the holy place, wherein<br/>
			Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00118">Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,<br/>
			Things did he hear, which the occasion were<br/>
			Both of his victory and the papal mantle.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00119">Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,<br/>
			To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,<br/>
			Which of salvation's way is the beginning.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00120">But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?<br/>
			I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,<br/>
			Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00121">Therefore, if I resign myself to come,<br/>
			I fear the coming may be ill-advised;<br/>
			Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00122">And as he is, who unwills what he willed,<br/>
			And by new thoughts doth his intention change,<br/>
			So that from his design he quite withdraws,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00123">Such I became, upon that dark hillside,<br/>
			Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,<br/>
			Which was so very prompt in the beginning.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00124">"If I have well thy language understood,"<br/>
			Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,<br/>
			"Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00125">Which many times a man encumbers so,<br/>
			It turns him back from honoured enterprise,<br/>
			As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00126">That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,<br/>
			I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard<br/>
			At the first moment when I grieved for thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00127">Among those was I who are in suspense,<br/>
			And a fair, saintly Lady called to me<br/>
			In such wise, I besought her to command me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00128">Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;<br/>
			And she began to say, gentle and low,<br/>
			With voice angelical, in her own language:<br/></p>
			<p id="id00129">'O spirit courteous of Mantua,<br/>
			Of whom the fame still in the world endures,<br/>
			And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00130">A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,<br/>
			Upon the desert slope is so impeded<br/>
			Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00131">And may, I fear, already be so lost,<br/>
			That I too late have risen to his succour,<br/>
			From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00132">Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,<br/>
			And with what needful is for his release,<br/>
			Assist him so, that I may be consoled.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00133">Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;<br/>
			I come from there, where I would fain return;<br/>
			Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00134">When I shall be in presence of my Lord,<br/>
			Full often will I praise thee unto him.'<br/>
			Then paused she, and thereafter I began:<br/></p>
			<p id="id00135">'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom<br/>
			The human race exceedeth all contained<br/>
			Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00136">So grateful unto me is thy commandment,<br/>
			To obey, if 'twere already done, were late;<br/>
			No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00137">But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun<br/>
			The here descending down into this centre,<br/>
			From the vast place thou burnest to return to.'<br/></p>
			<p id="id00138">'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,<br/>
			Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,<br/>
			'Why I am not afraid to enter here.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00139">Of those things only should one be afraid<br/>
			Which have the power of doing others harm;<br/>
			Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00140">God in his mercy such created me<br/>
			That misery of yours attains me not,<br/>
			Nor any flame assails me of this burning.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00141">A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves<br/>
			At this impediment, to which I send thee,<br/>
			So that stern judgment there above is broken.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00142">In her entreaty she besought Lucia,<br/>
			And said, "Thy faithful one now stands in need<br/>
			Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00143">Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,<br/>
			Hastened away, and came unto the place<br/>
			Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00144">"Beatrice" said she, "the true praise of God,<br/>
			Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,<br/>
			For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00145">Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?<br/>
			Dost thou not see the death that combats him<br/>
			Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00146">Never were persons in the world so swift<br/>
			To work their weal and to escape their woe,<br/>
			As I, after such words as these were uttered,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00147">Came hither downward from my blessed seat,<br/>
			Confiding in thy dignified discourse,<br/>
			Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'<br/></p>
			<p id="id00148">After she thus had spoken unto me,<br/>
			Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;<br/>
			Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00149">And unto thee I came, as she desired;<br/>
			I have delivered thee from that wild beast,<br/>
			Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00150">What is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?<br/>
			Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?<br/>
			Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00151">Seeing that three such Ladies benedight<br/>
			Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,<br/>
			And so much good my speech doth promise thee?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00152">Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,<br/>
			Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,<br/>
			Uplift themselves all open on their stems;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00153">Such I became with my exhausted strength,<br/>
			And such good courage to my heart there coursed,<br/>
			That I began, like an intrepid person:<br/></p>
			<p id="id00154">"O she compassionate, who succoured me,<br/>
			And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon<br/>
			The words of truth which she addressed to thee!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00155">Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed<br/>
			To the adventure, with these words of thine,<br/>
			That to my first intent I have returned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00156">Now go, for one sole will is in us both,<br/>
			Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou."<br/>
			Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00157">I entered on the deep and savage way.</p>
			<p id="id00158" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto III</p>
			<p id="id00159" style="margin-top: 2em">"Through me the way is to the city dolent;<br/>
			Through me the way is to eternal dole;<br/>
			Through me the way among the people lost.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00160">Justice incited my sublime Creator;<br/>
			Created me divine Omnipotence,<br/>
			The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00161">Before me there were no created things,<br/>
			Only eterne, and I eternal last.<br/>
			All hope abandon, ye who enter in!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00162">These words in sombre colour I beheld<br/>
			Written upon the summit of a gate;<br/>
			Whence I: "Their sense is, Master, hard to me!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00163">And he to me, as one experienced:<br/>
			"Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,<br/>
			All cowardice must needs be here extinct.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00164">We to the place have come, where I have told thee<br/>
			Thou shalt behold the people dolorous<br/>
			Who have foregone the good of intellect."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00165">And after he had laid his hand on mine<br/>
			With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,<br/>
			He led me in among the secret things.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00166">There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud<br/>
			Resounded through the air without a star,<br/>
			Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00167">Languages diverse, horrible dialects,<br/>
			Accents of anger, words of agony,<br/>
			And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00168">Made up a tumult that goes whirling on<br/>
			For ever in that air for ever black,<br/>
			Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00169">And I, who had my head with horror bound,<br/>
			Said: "Master, what is this which now I hear?<br/>
			What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00170">And he to me: "This miserable mode<br/>
			Maintain the melancholy souls of those<br/>
			Who lived withouten infamy or praise.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00171">Commingled are they with that caitiff choir<br/>
			Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,<br/>
			Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00172">The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;<br/>
			Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,<br/>
			For glory none the damned would have from them."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00173">And I: "O Master, what so grievous is<br/>
			To these, that maketh them lament so sore?"<br/>
			He answered: "I will tell thee very briefly.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00174">These have no longer any hope of death;<br/>
			And this blind life of theirs is so debased,<br/>
			They envious are of every other fate.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00175">No fame of them the world permits to be;<br/>
			Misericord and Justice both disdain them.<br/>
			Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00176">And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,<br/>
			Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,<br/>
			That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00177">And after it there came so long a train<br/>
			Of people, that I ne'er would have believed<br/>
			That ever Death so many had undone.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00178">When some among them I had recognised,<br/>
			I looked, and I beheld the shade of him<br/>
			Who made through cowardice the great refusal.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00179">Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,<br/>
			That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches<br/>
			Hateful to God and to his enemies.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00180">These miscreants, who never were alive,<br/>
			Were naked, and were stung exceedingly<br/>
			By gadflies and by hornets that were there.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00181">These did their faces irrigate with blood,<br/>
			Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet<br/>
			By the disgusting worms was gathered up.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00182">And when to gazing farther I betook me.<br/>
			People I saw on a great river's bank;<br/>
			Whence said I: "Master, now vouchsafe to me,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00183">That I may know who these are, and what law<br/>
			Makes them appear so ready to pass over,<br/>
			As I discern athwart the dusky light."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00184">And he to me: "These things shall all be known<br/>
			To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay<br/>
			Upon the dismal shore of Acheron."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00185">Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,<br/>
			Fearing my words might irksome be to him,<br/>
			From speech refrained I till we reached the river.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00186">And lo! towards us coming in a boat<br/>
			An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,<br/>
			Crying: "Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00187">Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;<br/>
			I come to lead you to the other shore,<br/>
			To the eternal shades in heat and frost.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00188">And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,<br/>
			Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!"<br/>
			But when he saw that I did not withdraw,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00189">He said: "By other ways, by other ports<br/>
			Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;<br/>
			A lighter vessel needs must carry thee."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00190">And unto him the Guide: "Vex thee not, Charon;<br/>
			It is so willed there where is power to do<br/>
			That which is willed; and farther question not."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00191">Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks<br/>
			Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,<br/>
			Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00192">But all those souls who weary were and naked<br/>
			Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,<br/>
			As soon as they had heard those cruel words.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00193">God they blasphemed and their progenitors,<br/>
			The human race, the place, the time, the seed<br/>
			Of their engendering and of their birth!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00194">Thereafter all together they drew back,<br/>
			Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,<br/>
			Which waiteth every man who fears not God.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00195">Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,<br/>
			Beckoning to them, collects them all together,<br/>
			Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00196">As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,<br/>
			First one and then another, till the branch<br/>
			Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00197">In similar wise the evil seed of Adam<br/>
			Throw themselves from that margin one by one,<br/>
			At signals, as a bird unto its lure.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00198">So they depart across the dusky wave,<br/>
			And ere upon the other side they land,<br/>
			Again on this side a new troop assembles.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00199">"My son," the courteous Master said to me,<br/>
			"All those who perish in the wrath of God<br/>
			Here meet together out of every land;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00200">And ready are they to pass o'er the river,<br/>
			Because celestial Justice spurs them on,<br/>
			So that their fear is turned into desire.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00201">This way there never passes a good soul;<br/>
			And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,<br/>
			Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00202">This being finished, all the dusk champaign<br/>
			Trembled so violently, that of that terror<br/>
			The recollection bathes me still with sweat.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00203">The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,<br/>
			And fulminated a vermilion light,<br/>
			Which overmastered in me every sense,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00204">And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</p>
			<p id="id00205" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto IV</p>
			<p id="id00206" style="margin-top: 2em">Broke the deep lethargy within my head<br/>
			A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,<br/>
			Like to a person who by force is wakened;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00207">And round about I moved my rested eyes,<br/>
			Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,<br/>
			To recognise the place wherein I was.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00208">True is it, that upon the verge I found me<br/>
			Of the abysmal valley dolorous,<br/>
			That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00209">Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,<br/>
			So that by fixing on its depths my sight<br/>
			Nothing whatever I discerned therein.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00210">"Let us descend now into the blind world,"<br/>
			Began the Poet, pallid utterly;<br/>
			"I will be first, and thou shalt second be."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00211">And I, who of his colour was aware,<br/>
			Said: "How shall I come, if thou art afraid,<br/>
			Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00212">And he to me: "The anguish of the people<br/>
			Who are below here in my face depicts<br/>
			That pity which for terror thou hast taken.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00213">Let us go on, for the long way impels us."<br/>
			Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter<br/>
			The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00214">There, as it seemed to me from listening,<br/>
			Were lamentations none, but only sighs,<br/>
			That tremble made the everlasting air.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00215">And this arose from sorrow without torment,<br/>
			Which the crowds had, that many were and great,<br/>
			Of infants and of women and of men.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00216">To me the Master good: "Thou dost not ask<br/>
			What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?<br/>
			Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00217">That they sinned not; and if they merit had,<br/>
			'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism<br/>
			Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00218">And if they were before Christianity,<br/>
			In the right manner they adored not God;<br/>
			And among such as these am I myself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00219">For such defects, and not for other guilt,<br/>
			Lost are we and are only so far punished,<br/>
			That without hope we live on in desire."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00220">Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,<br/>
			Because some people of much worthiness<br/>
			I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00221">"Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,"<br/>
			Began I, with desire of being certain<br/>
			Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00222">"Came any one by his own merit hence,<br/>
			Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?"<br/>
			And he, who understood my covert speech,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00223">Replied: "I was a novice in this state,<br/>
			When I saw hither come a Mighty One,<br/>
			With sign of victory incoronate.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00224">Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,<br/>
			And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,<br/>
			Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient<br/></p>
			<p id="id00225">Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,<br/>
			Israel with his father and his children,<br/>
			And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00226">And others many, and he made them blessed;<br/>
			And thou must know, that earlier than these<br/>
			Never were any human spirits saved."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00227">We ceased not to advance because he spake,<br/>
			But still were passing onward through the forest,<br/>
			The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00228">Not very far as yet our way had gone<br/>
			This side the summit, when I saw a fire<br/>
			That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00229">We were a little distant from it still,<br/>
			But not so far that I in part discerned not<br/>
			That honourable people held that place.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00230">"O thou who honourest every art and science,<br/>
			Who may these be, which such great honour have,<br/>
			That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00231">And he to me: "The honourable name,<br/>
			That sounds of them above there in thy life,<br/>
			Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00232">In the mean time a voice was heard by me:<br/>
			"All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;<br/>
			His shade returns again, that was departed."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00233">After the voice had ceased and quiet was,<br/>
			Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;<br/>
			Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00234">To say to me began my gracious Master:<br/>
			"Him with that falchion in his hand behold,<br/>
			Who comes before the three, even as their lord.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00235">That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;<br/>
			He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;<br/>
			The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00236">Because to each of these with me applies<br/>
			The name that solitary voice proclaimed,<br/>
			They do me honour, and in that do well."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00237">Thus I beheld assemble the fair school<br/>
			Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,<br/>
			Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00238">When they together had discoursed somewhat,<br/>
			They turned to me with signs of salutation,<br/>
			And on beholding this, my Master smiled;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00239">And more of honour still, much more, they did me,<br/>
			In that they made me one of their own band;<br/>
			So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00240">Thus we went on as far as to the light,<br/>
			Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,<br/>
			As was the saying of them where I was.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00241">We came unto a noble castle's foot,<br/>
			Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,<br/>
			Defended round by a fair rivulet;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00242">This we passed over even as firm ground;<br/>
			Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;<br/>
			We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00243">People were there with solemn eyes and slow,<br/>
			Of great authority in their countenance;<br/>
			They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00244">Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side<br/>
			Into an opening luminous and lofty,<br/>
			So that they all of them were visible.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00245">There opposite, upon the green enamel,<br/>
			Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,<br/>
			Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00246">I saw Electra with companions many,<br/>
			'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,<br/>
			Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00247">I saw Camilla and Penthesilea<br/>
			On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,<br/>
			Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00248">I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,<br/>
			Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,<br/>
			And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00249">When I had lifted up my brows a little,<br/>
			The Master I beheld of those who know,<br/>
			Sit with his philosophic family.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00250">All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.<br/>
			There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,<br/>
			Who nearer him before the others stand;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00251">Democritus, who puts the world on chance,<br/>
			Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,<br/>
			Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00252">Of qualities I saw the good collector,<br/>
			Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,<br/>
			Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00253">Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,<br/>
			Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,<br/>
			Averroes, who the great Comment made.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00254">I cannot all of them pourtray in full,<br/>
			Because so drives me onward the long theme,<br/>
			That many times the word comes short of fact.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00255">The sixfold company in two divides;<br/>
			Another way my sapient Guide conducts me<br/>
			Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00256">And to a place I come where nothing shines.</p>
			<p id="id00257" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto V</p>
			<p id="id00258" style="margin-top: 2em">Thus I descended out of the first circle<br/>
			Down to the second, that less space begirds,<br/>
			And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00259">There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;<br/>
			Examines the transgressions at the entrance;<br/>
			Judges, and sends according as he girds him.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00260">I say, that when the spirit evil-born<br/>
			Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;<br/>
			And this discriminator of transgressions<br/></p>
			<p id="id00261">Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;<br/>
			Girds himself with his tail as many times<br/>
			As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00262">Always before him many of them stand;<br/>
			They go by turns each one unto the judgment;<br/>
			They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00263">"O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry<br/>
			Comest," said Minos to me, when he saw me,<br/>
			Leaving the practice of so great an office,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00264">"Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;<br/>
			Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee."<br/>
			And unto him my Guide: "Why criest thou too?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00265">Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;<br/>
			It is so willed there where is power to do<br/>
			That which is willed; and ask no further question."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00266">And now begin the dolesome notes to grow<br/>
			Audible unto me; now am I come<br/>
			There where much lamentation strikes upon me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00267">I came into a place mute of all light,<br/>
			Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,<br/>
			If by opposing winds 't is combated.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00268">The infernal hurricane that never rests<br/>
			Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;<br/>
			Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00269">When they arrive before the precipice,<br/>
			There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,<br/>
			There they blaspheme the puissance divine.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00270">I understood that unto such a torment<br/>
			The carnal malefactors were condemned,<br/>
			Who reason subjugate to appetite.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00271">And as the wings of starlings bear them on<br/>
			In the cold season in large band and full,<br/>
			So doth that blast the spirits maledict;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00272">It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;<br/>
			No hope doth comfort them for evermore,<br/>
			Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00273">And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,<br/>
			Making in air a long line of themselves,<br/>
			So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00274">Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.<br/>
			Whereupon said I: "Master, who are those<br/>
			People, whom the black air so castigates?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00275">"The first of those, of whom intelligence<br/>
			Thou fain wouldst have," then said he unto me,<br/>
			"The empress was of many languages.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00276">To sensual vices she was so abandoned,<br/>
			That lustful she made licit in her law,<br/>
			To remove the blame to which she had been led.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00277">She is Semiramis, of whom we read<br/>
			That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;<br/>
			She held the land which now the Sultan rules.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00278">The next is she who killed herself for love,<br/>
			And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;<br/>
			Then Cleopatra the voluptuous."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00279">Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless<br/>
			Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,<br/>
			Who at the last hour combated with Love.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00280">Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand<br/>
			Shades did he name and point out with his finger,<br/>
			Whom Love had separated from our life.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00281">After that I had listened to my Teacher,<br/>
			Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,<br/>
			Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00282">And I began: "O Poet, willingly<br/>
			Speak would I to those two, who go together,<br/>
			And seem upon the wind to be so light."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00283">And, he to me: "Thou'lt mark, when they shall be<br/>
			Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them<br/>
			By love which leadeth them, and they will come."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00284">Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,<br/>
			My voice uplift I: "O ye weary souls!<br/>
			Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00285">As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,<br/>
			With open and steady wings to the sweet nest<br/>
			Fly through the air by their volition borne,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00286">So came they from the band where Dido is,<br/>
			Approaching us athwart the air malign,<br/>
			So strong was the affectionate appeal.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00287">"O living creature gracious and benignant,<br/>
			Who visiting goest through the purple air<br/>
			Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00288">If were the King of the Universe our friend,<br/>
			We would pray unto him to give thee peace,<br/>
			Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00289">Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,<br/>
			That will we hear, and we will speak to you,<br/>
			While silent is the wind, as it is now.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00290">Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,<br/>
			Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends<br/>
			To rest in peace with all his retinue.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00291">Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,<br/>
			Seized this man for the person beautiful<br/>
			That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00292">Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,<br/>
			Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,<br/>
			That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00293">Love has conducted us unto one death;<br/>
			Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!"<br/>
			These words were borne along from them to us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00294">As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,<br/>
			I bowed my face, and so long held it down<br/>
			Until the Poet said to me: "What thinkest?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00295">When I made answer, I began: "Alas!<br/>
			How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,<br/>
			Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00296">Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,<br/>
			And I began: "Thine agonies, Francesca,<br/>
			Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00297">But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,<br/>
			By what and in what manner Love conceded,<br/>
			That you should know your dubious desires?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00298">And she to me: "There is no greater sorrow<br/>
			Than to be mindful of the happy time<br/>
			In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00299">But, if to recognise the earliest root<br/>
			Of love in us thou hast so great desire,<br/>
			I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00300">One day we reading were for our delight<br/>
			Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.<br/>
			Alone we were and without any fear.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00301">Full many a time our eyes together drew<br/>
			That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;<br/>
			But one point only was it that o'ercame us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00302">When as we read of the much-longed-for smile<br/>
			Being by such a noble lover kissed,<br/>
			This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00303">Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.<br/>
			Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.<br/>
			That day no farther did we read therein."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00304">And all the while one spirit uttered this,<br/>
			The other one did weep so, that, for pity,<br/>
			I swooned away as if I had been dying,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00305">And fell, even as a dead body falls.</p>
			<p id="id00306" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto VI</p>
			<p id="id00307" style="margin-top: 2em">At the return of consciousness, that closed<br/>
			Before the pity of those two relations,<br/>
			Which utterly with sadness had confused me,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00308">New torments I behold, and new tormented<br/>
			Around me, whichsoever way I move,<br/>
			And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00309">In the third circle am I of the rain<br/>
			Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;<br/>
			Its law and quality are never new.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00310">Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,<br/>
			Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;<br/>
			Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00311">Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,<br/>
			With his three gullets like a dog is barking<br/>
			Over the people that are there submerged.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00312">Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,<br/>
			And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;<br/>
			He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00313">Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;<br/>
			One side they make a shelter for the other;<br/>
			Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00314">When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!<br/>
			His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;<br/>
			Not a limb had he that was motionless.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00315">And my Conductor, with his spans extended,<br/>
			Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,<br/>
			He threw it into those rapacious gullets.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00316">Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,<br/>
			And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,<br/>
			For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00317">The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed<br/>
			Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders<br/>
			Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00318">We passed across the shadows, which subdues<br/>
			The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet<br/>
			Upon their vanity that person seems.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00319">They all were lying prone upon the earth,<br/>
			Excepting one, who sat upright as soon<br/>
			As he beheld us passing on before him.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00320">"O thou that art conducted through this Hell,"<br/>
			He said to me, "recall me, if thou canst;<br/>
			Thyself wast made before I was unmade."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00321">And I to him: "The anguish which thou hast<br/>
			Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,<br/>
			So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00322">But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful<br/>
			A place art put, and in such punishment,<br/>
			If some are greater, none is so displeasing."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00323">And he to me: "Thy city, which is full<br/>
			Of envy so that now the sack runs over,<br/>
			Held me within it in the life serene.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00324">You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;<br/>
			For the pernicious sin of gluttony<br/>
			I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00325">And I, sad soul, am not the only one,<br/>
			For all these suffer the like penalty<br/>
			For the like sin;" and word no more spake he.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00326">I answered him: "Ciacco, thy wretchedness<br/>
			Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;<br/>
			But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come<br/></p>
			<p id="id00327">The citizens of the divided city;<br/>
			If any there be just; and the occasion<br/>
			Tell me why so much discord has assailed it."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00328">And he to me: "They, after long contention,<br/>
			Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party<br/>
			Will drive the other out with much offence.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00329">Then afterwards behoves it this one fall<br/>
			Within three suns, and rise again the other<br/>
			By force of him who now is on the coast.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00330">High will it hold its forehead a long while,<br/>
			Keeping the other under heavy burdens,<br/>
			Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00331">The just are two, and are not understood there;<br/>
			Envy and Arrogance and Avarice<br/>
			Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00332">Here ended he his tearful utterance;<br/>
			And I to him: "I wish thee still to teach me,<br/>
			And make a gift to me of further speech.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00333">Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,<br/>
			Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,<br/>
			And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00334">Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;<br/>
			For great desire constraineth me to learn<br/>
			If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00335">And he: "They are among the blacker souls;<br/>
			A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;<br/>
			If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00336">But when thou art again in the sweet world,<br/>
			I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;<br/>
			No more I tell thee and no more I answer."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00337">Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,<br/>
			Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;<br/>
			He fell therewith prone like the other blind.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00338">And the Guide said to me: "He wakes no more<br/>
			This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;<br/>
			When shall approach the hostile Potentate,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00339">Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,<br/>
			Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,<br/>
			Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00340">So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture<br/>
			Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,<br/>
			Touching a little on the future life.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00341">Wherefore I said: "Master, these torments here,<br/>
			Will they increase after the mighty sentence,<br/>
			Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00342">And he to me: "Return unto thy science,<br/>
			Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,<br/>
			The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00343">Albeit that this people maledict<br/>
			To true perfection never can attain,<br/>
			Hereafter more than now they look to be."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00344">Round in a circle by that road we went,<br/>
			Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;<br/>
			We came unto the point where the descent is;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00345">There we found Plutus the great enemy.</p>
			<p id="id00346" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto VII</p>
			<p id="id00347" style="margin-top: 2em">"Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!"<br/>
			Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;<br/>
			And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00348">Said, to encourage me: "Let not thy fear<br/>
			Harm thee; for any power that he may have<br/>
			Shall not prevent thy going down this crag."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00349">Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,<br/>
			And said: "Be silent, thou accursed wolf;<br/>
			Consume within thyself with thine own rage.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00350">Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;<br/>
			Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought<br/>
			Vengeance upon the proud adultery."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00351">Even as the sails inflated by the wind<br/>
			Involved together fall when snaps the mast,<br/>
			So fell the cruel monster to the earth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00352">Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,<br/>
			Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore<br/>
			Which all the woe of the universe insacks.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00353">Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many<br/>
			New toils and sufferings as I beheld?<br/>
			And why doth our transgression waste us so?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00354">As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,<br/>
			That breaks itself on that which it encounters,<br/>
			So here the folk must dance their roundelay.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00355">Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,<br/>
			On one side and the other, with great howls,<br/>
			Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00356">They clashed together, and then at that point<br/>
			Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,<br/>
			Crying, "Why keepest?" and, "Why squanderest thou?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00357">Thus they returned along the lurid circle<br/>
			On either hand unto the opposite point,<br/>
			Shouting their shameful metre evermore.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00358">Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about<br/>
			Through his half-circle to another joust;<br/>
			And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00359">Exclaimed: "My Master, now declare to me<br/>
			What people these are, and if all were clerks,<br/>
			These shaven crowns upon the left of us."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00360">And he to me: "All of them were asquint<br/>
			In intellect in the first life, so much<br/>
			That there with measure they no spending made.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00361">Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,<br/>
			Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle,<br/>
			Where sunders them the opposite defect.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00362">Clerks those were who no hairy covering<br/>
			Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,<br/>
			In whom doth Avarice practise its excess."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00363">And I: "My Master, among such as these<br/>
			I ought forsooth to recognise some few,<br/>
			Who were infected with these maladies."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00364">And he to me: "Vain thought thou entertainest;<br/>
			The undiscerning life which made them sordid<br/>
			Now makes them unto all discernment dim.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00365">Forever shall they come to these two buttings;<br/>
			These from the sepulchre shall rise again<br/>
			With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00366">Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world<br/>
			Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;<br/>
			Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00367">Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce<br/>
			Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,<br/>
			For which the human race each other buffet;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00368">For all the gold that is beneath the moon,<br/>
			Or ever has been, of these weary souls<br/>
			Could never make a single one repose."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00369">"Master," I said to him, "now tell me also<br/>
			What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,<br/>
			That has the world's goods so within its clutches?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00370">And he to me: "O creatures imbecile,<br/>
			What ignorance is this which doth beset you?<br/>
			Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00371">He whose omniscience everything transcends<br/>
			The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,<br/>
			That every part to every part may shine,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00372">Distributing the light in equal measure;<br/>
			He in like manner to the mundane splendours<br/>
			Ordained a general ministress and guide,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00373">That she might change at times the empty treasures<br/>
			From race to race, from one blood to another,<br/>
			Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00374">Therefore one people triumphs, and another<br/>
			Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,<br/>
			Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00375">Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;<br/>
			She makes provision, judges, and pursues<br/>
			Her governance, as theirs the other gods.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00376">Her permutations have not any truce;<br/>
			Necessity makes her precipitate,<br/>
			So often cometh who his turn obtains.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00377">And this is she who is so crucified<br/>
			Even by those who ought to give her praise,<br/>
			Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00378">But she is blissful, and she hears it not;<br/>
			Among the other primal creatures gladsome<br/>
			She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00379">Let us descend now unto greater woe;<br/>
			Already sinks each star that was ascending<br/>
			When I set out, and loitering is forbidden."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00380">We crossed the circle to the other bank,<br/>
			Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself<br/>
			Along a gully that runs out of it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00381">The water was more sombre far than perse;<br/>
			And we, in company with the dusky waves,<br/>
			Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00382">A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,<br/>
			This tristful brooklet, when it has descended<br/>
			Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00383">And I, who stood intent upon beholding,<br/>
			Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,<br/>
			All of them naked and with angry look.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00384">They smote each other not alone with hands,<br/>
			But with the head and with the breast and feet,<br/>
			Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00385">Said the good Master: "Son, thou now beholdest<br/>
			The souls of those whom anger overcame;<br/>
			And likewise I would have thee know for certain<br/></p>
			<p id="id00386">Beneath the water people are who sigh<br/>
			And make this water bubble at the surface,<br/>
			As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00387">Fixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were<br/>
			In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,<br/>
			Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00388">Now we are sullen in this sable mire.'<br/>
			This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,<br/>
			For with unbroken words they cannot say it."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00389">Thus we went circling round the filthy fen<br/>
			A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,<br/>
			With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00390">Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.</p>
			<p id="id00391" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto VIII</p>
			<p id="id00392" style="margin-top: 2em">I say, continuing, that long before<br/>
			We to the foot of that high tower had come,<br/>
			Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00393">By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,<br/>
			And from afar another answer them,<br/>
			So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00394">And, to the sea of all discernment turned,<br/>
			I said: "What sayeth this, and what respondeth<br/>
			That other fire? and who are they that made it?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00395">And he to me: "Across the turbid waves<br/>
			What is expected thou canst now discern,<br/>
			If reek of the morass conceal it not."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00396">Cord never shot an arrow from itself<br/>
			That sped away athwart the air so swift,<br/>
			As I beheld a very little boat<br/></p>
			<p id="id00397">Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,<br/>
			Under the guidance of a single pilot,<br/>
			Who shouted, "Now art thou arrived, fell soul?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00398">"Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain<br/>
			For this once," said my Lord; "thou shalt not have us<br/>
			Longer than in the passing of the slough."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00399">As he who listens to some great deceit<br/>
			That has been done to him, and then resents it,<br/>
			Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00400">My Guide descended down into the boat,<br/>
			And then he made me enter after him,<br/>
			And only when I entered seemed it laden.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00401">Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,<br/>
			The antique prow goes on its way, dividing<br/>
			More of the water than 'tis wont with others.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00402">While we were running through the dead canal,<br/>
			Uprose in front of me one full of mire,<br/>
			And said, "Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00403">And I to him: "Although I come, I stay not;<br/>
			But who art thou that hast become so squalid?"<br/>
			"Thou seest that I am one who weeps," he answered.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00404">And I to him: "With weeping and with wailing,<br/>
			Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;<br/>
			For thee I know, though thou art all defiled."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00405">Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;<br/>
			Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,<br/>
			Saying, "Away there with the other dogs!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00406">Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;<br/>
			He kissed my face, and said: "Disdainful soul,<br/>
			Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00407">That was an arrogant person in the world;<br/>
			Goodness is none, that decks his memory;<br/>
			So likewise here his shade is furious.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00408">How many are esteemed great kings up there,<br/>
			Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,<br/>
			Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00409">And I: "My Master, much should I be pleased,<br/>
			If I could see him soused into this broth,<br/>
			Before we issue forth out of the lake."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00410">And he to me: "Ere unto thee the shore<br/>
			Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;<br/>
			Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00411">A little after that, I saw such havoc<br/>
			Made of him by the people of the mire,<br/>
			That still I praise and thank my God for it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00412">They all were shouting, "At Philippo Argenti!"<br/>
			And that exasperate spirit Florentine<br/>
			Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00413">We left him there, and more of him I tell not;<br/>
			But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,<br/>
			Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00414">And the good Master said: "Even now, my Son,<br/>
			The city draweth near whose name is Dis,<br/>
			With the grave citizens, with the great throng."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00415">And I: "Its mosques already, Master, clearly<br/>
			Within there in the valley I discern<br/>
			Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire<br/></p>
			<p id="id00416">They were."  And he to me: "The fire eternal<br/>
			That kindles them within makes them look red,<br/>
			As thou beholdest in this nether Hell."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00417">Then we arrived within the moats profound,<br/>
			That circumvallate that disconsolate city;<br/>
			The walls appeared to me to be of iron.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00418">Not without making first a circuit wide,<br/>
			We came unto a place where loud the pilot<br/>
			Cried out to us, "Debark, here is the entrance."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00419">More than a thousand at the gates I saw<br/>
			Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily<br/>
			Were saying, "Who is this that without death<br/></p>
			<p id="id00420">Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?"<br/>
			And my sagacious Master made a sign<br/>
			Of wishing secretly to speak with them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00421">A little then they quelled their great disdain,<br/>
			And said: "Come thou alone, and he begone<br/>
			Who has so boldly entered these dominions.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00422">Let him return alone by his mad road;<br/>
			Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,<br/>
			Who hast escorted him through such dark regions."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00423">Think, Reader, if I was discomforted<br/>
			At utterance of the accursed words;<br/>
			For never to return here I believed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00424">"O my dear Guide, who more than seven times<br/>
			Hast rendered me security, and drawn me<br/>
			From imminent peril that before me stood,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00425">Do not desert me," said I, "thus undone;<br/>
			And if the going farther be denied us,<br/>
			Let us retrace our steps together swiftly."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00426">And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,<br/>
			Said unto me: "Fear not; because our passage<br/>
			None can take from us, it by Such is given.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00427">But here await me, and thy weary spirit<br/>
			Comfort and nourish with a better hope;<br/>
			For in this nether world I will not leave thee."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00428">So onward goes and there abandons me<br/>
			My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,<br/>
			For No and Yes within my head contend.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00429">I could not hear what he proposed to them;<br/>
			But with them there he did not linger long,<br/>
			Ere each within in rivalry ran back.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00430">They closed the portals, those our adversaries,<br/>
			On my Lord's breast, who had remained without<br/>
			And turned to me with footsteps far between.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00431">His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he<br/>
			Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,<br/>
			"Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00432">And unto me: "Thou, because I am angry,<br/>
			Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,<br/>
			Whatever for defence within be planned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00433">This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;<br/>
			For once they used it at less secret gate,<br/>
			Which finds itself without a fastening still.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00434">O'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;<br/>
			And now this side of it descends the steep,<br/>
			Passing across the circles without escort,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00435">One by whose means the city shall be opened."</p>
			<p id="id00436" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto IX</p>
			<p id="id00437" style="margin-top: 2em">That hue which cowardice brought out on me,<br/>
			Beholding my Conductor backward turn,<br/>
			Sooner repressed within him his new colour.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00438">He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,<br/>
			Because the eye could not conduct him far<br/>
			Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00439">"Still it behoveth us to win the fight,"<br/>
			Began he; "Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .<br/>
			O how I long that some one here arrive!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00440">Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning<br/>
			He covered up with what came afterward,<br/>
			That they were words quite different from the first;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00441">But none the less his saying gave me fear,<br/>
			Because I carried out the broken phrase,<br/>
			Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00442">"Into this bottom of the doleful conch<br/>
			Doth any e'er descend from the first grade,<br/>
			Which for its pain has only hope cut off?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00443">This question put I; and he answered me:<br/>
			"Seldom it comes to pass that one of us<br/>
			Maketh the journey upon which I go.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00444">True is it, once before I here below<br/>
			Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,<br/>
			Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00445">Naked of me short while the flesh had been,<br/>
			Before within that wall she made me enter,<br/>
			To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00446">That is the lowest region and the darkest,<br/>
			And farthest from the heaven which circles all.<br/>
			Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00447">This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,<br/>
			Encompasses about the city dolent,<br/>
			Where now we cannot enter without anger."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00448">And more he said, but not in mind I have it;<br/>
			Because mine eye had altogether drawn me<br/>
			Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00449">Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen<br/>
			The three infernal Furies stained with blood,<br/>
			Who had the limbs of women and their mien,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00450">And with the greenest hydras were begirt;<br/>
			Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,<br/>
			Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00451">And he who well the handmaids of the Queen<br/>
			Of everlasting lamentation knew,<br/>
			Said unto me: "Behold the fierce Erinnys.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00452">This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;<br/>
			She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;<br/>
			Tisiphone is between;" and then was silent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00453">Each one her breast was rending with her nails;<br/>
			They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,<br/>
			That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00454">"Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!"<br/>
			All shouted looking down; "in evil hour<br/>
			Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00455">"Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,<br/>
			For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,<br/>
			No more returning upward would there be."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00456">Thus said the Master; and he turned me round<br/>
			Himself, and trusted not unto my hands<br/>
			So far as not to blind me with his own.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00457">O ye who have undistempered intellects,<br/>
			Observe the doctrine that conceals itself<br/>
			Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00458">And now there came across the turbid waves<br/>
			The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,<br/>
			Because of which both of the margins trembled;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00459">Not otherwise it was than of a wind<br/>
			Impetuous on account of adverse heats,<br/>
			That smites the forest, and, without restraint,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00460">The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;<br/>
			Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,<br/>
			And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00461">Mine eyes he loosed, and said: "Direct the nerve<br/>
			Of vision now along that ancient foam,<br/>
			There yonder where that smoke is most intense."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00462">Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent<br/>
			Across the water scatter all abroad,<br/>
			Until each one is huddled in the earth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00463">More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,<br/>
			Thus fleeing from before one who on foot<br/>
			Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00464">From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,<br/>
			Waving his left hand oft in front of him,<br/>
			And only with that anguish seemed he weary.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00465">Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,<br/>
			And to the Master turned; and he made sign<br/>
			That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00466">Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!<br/>
			He reached the gate, and with a little rod<br/>
			He opened it, for there was no resistance.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00467">"O banished out of Heaven, people despised!"<br/>
			Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;<br/>
			"Whence is this arrogance within you couched?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00468">Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,<br/>
			From which the end can never be cut off,<br/>
			And which has many times increased your pain?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00469">What helpeth it to butt against the fates?<br/>
			Your Cerberus, if you remember well,<br/>
			For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00470">Then he returned along the miry road,<br/>
			And spake no word to us, but had the look<br/>
			Of one whom other care constrains and goads<br/></p>
			<p id="id00471">Than that of him who in his presence is;<br/>
			And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,<br/>
			After those holy words all confident.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00472">Within we entered without any contest;<br/>
			And I, who inclination had to see<br/>
			What the condition such a fortress holds,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00473">Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,<br/>
			And see on every hand an ample plain,<br/>
			Full of distress and torment terrible.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00474">Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,<br/>
			Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,<br/>
			That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00475">The sepulchres make all the place uneven;<br/>
			So likewise did they there on every side,<br/>
			Saving that there the manner was more bitter;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00476">For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,<br/>
			By which they so intensely heated were,<br/>
			That iron more so asks not any art.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00477">All of their coverings uplifted were,<br/>
			And from them issued forth such dire laments,<br/>
			Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00478">And I: "My Master, what are all those people<br/>
			Who, having sepulture within those tombs,<br/>
			Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00479">And he to me: "Here are the Heresiarchs,<br/>
			With their disciples of all sects, and much<br/>
			More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00480">Here like together with its like is buried;<br/>
			And more and less the monuments are heated."<br/>
			And when he to the right had turned, we passed<br/></p>
			<p id="id00481">Between the torments and high parapets.</p>
			<p id="id00482" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto X</p>
			<p id="id00483" style="margin-top: 2em">Now onward goes, along a narrow path<br/>
			Between the torments and the city wall,<br/>
			My Master, and I follow at his back.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00484">"O power supreme, that through these impious circles<br/>
			Turnest me," I began, "as pleases thee,<br/>
			Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00485">The people who are lying in these tombs,<br/>
			Might they be seen? already are uplifted<br/>
			The covers all, and no one keepeth guard."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00486">And he to me: "They all will be closed up<br/>
			When from Jehoshaphat they shall return<br/>
			Here with the bodies they have left above.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00487">Their cemetery have upon this side<br/>
			With Epicurus all his followers,<br/>
			Who with the body mortal make the soul;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00488">But in the question thou dost put to me,<br/>
			Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,<br/>
			And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00489">And I: "Good Leader, I but keep concealed<br/>
			From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,<br/>
			Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00490">"O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire<br/>
			Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,<br/>
			Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00491">Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest<br/>
			A native of that noble fatherland,<br/>
			To which perhaps I too molestful was."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00492">Upon a sudden issued forth this sound<br/>
			From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,<br/>
			Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00493">And unto me he said: "Turn thee; what dost thou?<br/>
			Behold there Farinata who has risen;<br/>
			From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00494">I had already fixed mine eyes on his,<br/>
			And he uprose erect with breast and front<br/>
			E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00495">And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader<br/>
			Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,<br/>
			Exclaiming, "Let thy words explicit be."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00496">As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb<br/>
			Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,<br/>
			Then asked of me, "Who were thine ancestors?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00497">I, who desirous of obeying was,<br/>
			Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;<br/>
			Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00498">Then said he: "Fiercely adverse have they been<br/>
			To me, and to my fathers, and my party;<br/>
			So that two several times I scattered them."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00499">"If they were banished, they returned on all sides,"<br/>
			I answered him, "the first time and the second;<br/>
			But yours have not acquired that art aright."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00500">Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered<br/>
			Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;<br/>
			I think that he had risen on his knees.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00501">Round me he gazed, as if solicitude<br/>
			He had to see if some one else were with me,<br/>
			But after his suspicion was all spent,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00502">Weeping, he said to me: "If through this blind<br/>
			Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,<br/>
			Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00503">And I to him: "I come not of myself;<br/>
			He who is waiting yonder leads me here,<br/>
			Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00504">His language and the mode of punishment<br/>
			Already unto me had read his name;<br/>
			On that account my answer was so full.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00505">Up starting suddenly, he cried out: "How<br/>
			Saidst thou,—he had?  Is he not still alive?<br/>
			Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00506">When he became aware of some delay,<br/>
			Which I before my answer made, supine<br/>
			He fell again, and forth appeared no more.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00507">But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire<br/>
			I had remained, did not his aspect change,<br/>
			Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00508">"And if," continuing his first discourse,<br/>
			"They have that art," he said, "not learned aright,<br/>
			That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00509">But fifty times shall not rekindled be<br/>
			The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,<br/>
			Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00510">And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,<br/>
			Say why that people is so pitiless<br/>
			Against my race in each one of its laws?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00511">Whence I to him: "The slaughter and great carnage<br/>
			Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause<br/>
			Such orisons in our temple to be made."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00512">After his head he with a sigh had shaken,<br/>
			"There I was not alone," he said, "nor surely<br/>
			Without a cause had with the others moved.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00513">But there I was alone, where every one<br/>
			Consented to the laying waste of Florence,<br/>
			He who defended her with open face."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00514">"Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,"<br/>
			I him entreated, "solve for me that knot,<br/>
			Which has entangled my conceptions here.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00515">It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,<br/>
			Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,<br/>
			And in the present have another mode."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00516">"We see, like those who have imperfect sight,<br/>
			The things," he said, "that distant are from us;<br/>
			So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00517">When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain<br/>
			Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,<br/>
			Not anything know we of your human state.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00518">Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead<br/>
			Will be our knowledge from the moment when<br/>
			The portal of the future shall be closed."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00519">Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,<br/>
			Said: "Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,<br/>
			That still his son is with the living joined.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00520">And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,<br/>
			Tell him I did it because I was thinking<br/>
			Already of the error you have solved me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00521">And now my Master was recalling me,<br/>
			Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit<br/>
			That he would tell me who was with him there.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00522">He said: "With more than a thousand here I lie;<br/>
			Within here is the second Frederick,<br/>
			And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00523">Thereon he hid himself; and I towards<br/>
			The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting<br/>
			Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00524">He moved along; and afterward thus going,<br/>
			He said to me, "Why art thou so bewildered?"<br/>
			And I in his inquiry satisfied him.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00525">"Let memory preserve what thou hast heard<br/>
			Against thyself," that Sage commanded me,<br/>
			"And now attend here;" and he raised his finger.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00526">"When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet<br/>
			Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,<br/>
			From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00527">Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;<br/>
			We left the wall, and went towards the middle,<br/>
			Along a path that strikes into a valley,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00528">Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.</p>
			<p id="id00529" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XI</p>
			<p id="id00530" style="margin-top: 2em">Upon the margin of a lofty bank<br/>
			Which great rocks broken in a circle made,<br/>
			We came upon a still more cruel throng;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00531">And there, by reason of the horrible<br/>
			Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,<br/>
			We drew ourselves aside behind the cover<br/></p>
			<p id="id00532">Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,<br/>
			Which said: "Pope Anastasius I hold,<br/>
			Whom out of the right way Photinus drew."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00533">"Slow it behoveth our descent to be,<br/>
			So that the sense be first a little used<br/>
			To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00534">The Master thus; and unto him I said,<br/>
			"Some compensation find, that the time pass not<br/>
			Idly;" and he: "Thou seest I think of that.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00535">My son, upon the inside of these rocks,"<br/>
			Began he then to say, "are three small circles,<br/>
			From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00536">They all are full of spirits maledict;<br/>
			But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,<br/>
			Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00537">Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,<br/>
			Injury is the end; and all such end<br/>
			Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00538">But because fraud is man's peculiar vice,<br/>
			More it displeases God; and so stand lowest<br/>
			The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00539">All the first circle of the Violent is;<br/>
			But since force may be used against three persons,<br/>
			In three rounds 'tis divided and constructed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00540">To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we<br/>
			Use force; I say on them and on their things,<br/>
			As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00541">A death by violence, and painful wounds,<br/>
			Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance<br/>
			Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00542">Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,<br/>
			Marauders, and freebooters, the first round<br/>
			Tormenteth all in companies diverse.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00543">Man may lay violent hands upon himself<br/>
			And his own goods; and therefore in the second<br/>
			Round must perforce without avail repent<br/></p>
			<p id="id00544">Whoever of your world deprives himself,<br/>
			Who games, and dissipates his property,<br/>
			And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00545">Violence can be done the Deity,<br/>
			In heart denying and blaspheming Him,<br/>
			And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00546">And for this reason doth the smallest round<br/>
			Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,<br/>
			And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00547">Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,<br/>
			A man may practise upon him who trusts,<br/>
			And him who doth no confidence imburse.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00548">This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers<br/>
			Only the bond of love which Nature makes;<br/>
			Wherefore within the second circle nestle<br/></p>
			<p id="id00549">Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,<br/>
			Falsification, theft, and simony,<br/>
			Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00550">By the other mode, forgotten is that love<br/>
			Which Nature makes, and what is after added,<br/>
			From which there is a special faith engendered.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00551">Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is<br/>
			Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,<br/>
			Whoe'er betrays for ever is consumed."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00552">And I: "My Master, clear enough proceeds<br/>
			Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes<br/>
			This cavern and the people who possess it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00553">But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,<br/>
			Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,<br/>
			And who encounter with such bitter tongues,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00554">Wherefore are they inside of the red city<br/>
			Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,<br/>
			And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00555">And unto me he said: "Why wanders so<br/>
			Thine intellect from that which it is wont?<br/>
			Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00556">Hast thou no recollection of those words<br/>
			With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses<br/>
			The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,—<br/></p>
			<p id="id00557">Incontinence, and Malice, and insane<br/>
			Bestiality? and how Incontinence<br/>
			Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00558">If thou regardest this conclusion well,<br/>
			And to thy mind recallest who they are<br/>
			That up outside are undergoing penance,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00559">Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons<br/>
			They separated are, and why less wroth<br/>
			Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00560">"O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,<br/>
			Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,<br/>
			That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00561">Once more a little backward turn thee," said I,<br/>
			"There where thou sayest that usury offends<br/>
			Goodness divine, and disengage the knot."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00562">"Philosophy," he said, "to him who heeds it,<br/>
			Noteth, not only in one place alone,<br/>
			After what manner Nature takes her course<br/></p>
			<p id="id00563">From Intellect Divine, and from its art;<br/>
			And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,<br/>
			After not many pages shalt thou find,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00564">That this your art as far as possible<br/>
			Follows, as the disciple doth the master;<br/>
			So that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00565">From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind<br/>
			Genesis at the beginning, it behoves<br/>
			Mankind to gain their life and to advance;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00566">And since the usurer takes another way,<br/>
			Nature herself and in her follower<br/>
			Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00567">But follow, now, as I would fain go on,<br/>
			For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,<br/>
			And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00568">And far beyond there we descend the crag."</p>
			<p id="id00569" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XII</p>
			<p id="id00570" style="margin-top: 2em">The place where to descend the bank we came<br/>
			Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,<br/>
			Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00571">Such as that ruin is which in the flank<br/>
			Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,<br/>
			Either by earthquake or by failing stay,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00572">For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,<br/>
			Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,<br/>
			Some path 'twould give to him who was above;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00573">Even such was the descent of that ravine,<br/>
			And on the border of the broken chasm<br/>
			The infamy of Crete was stretched along,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00574">Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;<br/>
			And when he us beheld, he bit himself,<br/>
			Even as one whom anger racks within.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00575">My Sage towards him shouted: "Peradventure<br/>
			Thou think'st that here may be the Duke of Athens,<br/>
			Who in the world above brought death to thee?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00576">Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not<br/>
			Instructed by thy sister, but he comes<br/>
			In order to behold your punishments."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00577">As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment<br/>
			In which he has received the mortal blow,<br/>
			Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00578">The Minotaur beheld I do the like;<br/>
			And he, the wary, cried: "Run to the passage;<br/>
			While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00579">Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge<br/>
			Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves<br/>
			Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00580">Thoughtful I went; and he said: "Thou art thinking<br/>
			Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded<br/>
			By that brute anger which just now I quenched.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00581">Now will I have thee know, the other time<br/>
			I here descended to the nether Hell,<br/>
			This precipice had not yet fallen down.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00582">But truly, if I well discern, a little<br/>
			Before His coming who the mighty spoil<br/>
			Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00583">Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley<br/>
			Trembled so, that I thought the Universe<br/>
			Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think<br/></p>
			<p id="id00584">The world ofttimes converted into chaos;<br/>
			And at that moment this primeval crag<br/>
			Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00585">But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near<br/>
			The river of blood, within which boiling is<br/>
			Whoe'er by violence doth injure others."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00586">O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,<br/>
			That spurs us onward so in our short life,<br/>
			And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00587">I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,<br/>
			As one which all the plain encompasses,<br/>
			Conformable to what my Guide had said.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00588">And between this and the embankment's foot<br/>
			Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,<br/>
			As in the world they used the chase to follow.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00589">Beholding us descend, each one stood still,<br/>
			And from the squadron three detached themselves,<br/>
			With bows and arrows in advance selected;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00590">And from afar one cried: "Unto what torment<br/>
			Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?<br/>
			Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00591">My Master said: "Our answer will we make<br/>
			To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,<br/>
			That will of thine was evermore so hasty."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00592">Then touched he me, and said: "This one is Nessus,<br/>
			Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,<br/>
			And for himself, himself did vengeance take.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00593">And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,<br/>
			Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;<br/>
			That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00594">Thousands and thousands go about the moat<br/>
			Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges<br/>
			Out of the blood, more than his crime allots."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00595">Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;<br/>
			Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch<br/>
			Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00596">After he had uncovered his great mouth,<br/>
			He said to his companions: "Are you ware<br/>
			That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00597">Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men."<br/>
			And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,<br/>
			Where the two natures are together joined,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00598">Replied: "Indeed he lives, and thus alone<br/>
			Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;<br/>
			Necessity, and not delight, impels us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00599">Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,<br/>
			Who unto me committed this new office;<br/>
			No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00600">But by that virtue through which I am moving<br/>
			My steps along this savage thoroughfare,<br/>
			Give us some one of thine, to be with us,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00601">And who may show us where to pass the ford,<br/>
			And who may carry this one on his back;<br/>
			For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00602">Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,<br/>
			And said to Nessus: "Turn and do thou guide them,<br/>
			And warn aside, if other band may meet you."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00603">We with our faithful escort onward moved<br/>
			Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,<br/>
			Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00604">People I saw within up to the eyebrows,<br/>
			And the great Centaur said: "Tyrants are these,<br/>
			Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00605">Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here<br/>
			Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius<br/>
			Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00606">That forehead there which has the hair so black<br/>
			Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,<br/>
			Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00607">Up in the world was by his stepson slain."<br/>
			Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,<br/>
			"Now he be first to thee, and second I."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00608">A little farther on the Centaur stopped<br/>
			Above a folk, who far down as the throat<br/>
			Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00609">A shade he showed us on one side alone,<br/>
			Saying: "He cleft asunder in God's bosom<br/>
			The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00610">Then people saw I, who from out the river<br/>
			Lifted their heads and also all the chest;<br/>
			And many among these I recognised.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00611">Thus ever more and more grew shallower<br/>
			That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;<br/>
			And there across the moat our passage was.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00612">"Even as thou here upon this side beholdest<br/>
			The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,"<br/>
			The Centaur said, "I wish thee to believe<br/></p>
			<p id="id00613">That on this other more and more declines<br/>
			Its bed, until it reunites itself<br/>
			Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00614">Justice divine, upon this side, is goading<br/>
			That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,<br/>
			And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks<br/></p>
			<p id="id00615">The tears which with the boiling it unseals<br/>
			In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,<br/>
			Who made upon the highways so much war."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00616">Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.</p>
			<p id="id00617" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XIII</p>
			<p id="id00618" style="margin-top: 2em">Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,<br/>

			<p id="id00619">Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,<br/>
			Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,<br/>
			Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00620">Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,<br/>
			Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold<br/>

			<p id="id00626">I think he thought that I perhaps might think<br/>
			So many voices issued through those trunks<br/>
			From people who concealed themselves from us;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00627">Therefore the Master said: "If thou break off<br/>
			Some little spray from any of these trees,<br/>
			The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00628">Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,<br/>
			And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;<br/>
			And the trunk cried, "Why dost thou mangle me?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00629">After it had become embrowned with blood,<br/>
			It recommenced its cry: "Why dost thou rend me?<br/>
			Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00630">Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;<br/>
			Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,<br/>
			Even if the souls of serpents we had been."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00631">As out of a green brand, that is on fire<br/>
			At one of the ends, and from the other drips<br/>
			And hisses with the wind that is escaping;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00632">So from that splinter issued forth together<br/>
			Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip<br/>
			Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00633">"Had he been able sooner to believe,"<br/>
			My Sage made answer, "O thou wounded soul,<br/>
			What only in my verses he has seen,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00634">Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;<br/>
			Whereas the thing incredible has caused me<br/>
			To put him to an act which grieveth me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00635">But tell him who thou wast, so that by way<br/>
			Of some amends thy fame he may refresh<br/>
			Up in the world, to which he can return."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00636">And the trunk said: "So thy sweet words allure me,<br/>
			I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,<br/>
			That I a little to discourse am tempted.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00637">I am the one who both keys had in keeping<br/>
			Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro<br/>
			So softly in unlocking and in locking,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00638">That from his secrets most men I withheld;<br/>
			Fidelity I bore the glorious office<br/>
			So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00639">The courtesan who never from the dwelling<br/>
			Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,<br/>
			Death universal and the vice of courts,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00640">Inflamed against me all the other minds,<br/>
			And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,<br/>
			That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00641">My spirit, in disdainful exultation,<br/>
			Thinking by dying to escape disdain,<br/>
			Made me unjust against myself, the just.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00642">I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,<br/>
			Do swear to you that never broke I faith<br/>
			Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00643">And to the world if one of you return,<br/>
			Let him my memory comfort, which is lying<br/>
			Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00644">Waited awhile, and then: "Since he is silent,"<br/>
			The Poet said to me, "lose not the time,<br/>
			But speak, and question him, if more may please thee."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00645">Whence I to him: "Do thou again inquire<br/>
			Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;<br/>
			For I cannot, such pity is in my heart."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00646">Therefore he recommenced: "So may the man<br/>
			Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,<br/>
			Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased<br/></p>
			<p id="id00647">To tell us in what way the soul is bound<br/>
			Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,<br/>
			If any from such members e'er is freed."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00648">Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward<br/>
			The wind was into such a voice converted:<br/>
			"With brevity shall be replied to you.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00649">When the exasperated soul abandons<br/>
			The body whence it rent itself away,<br/>
			Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00650">It falls into the forest, and no part<br/>
			Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,<br/>
			There like a grain of spelt it germinates.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00651">It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;<br/>
			The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,<br/>
			Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00652">Like others for our spoils shall we return;<br/>
			But not that any one may them revest,<br/>
			For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00653">Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal<br/>
			Forest our bodies shall suspended be,<br/>
			Each to the thorn of his molested shade."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00654">We were attentive still unto the trunk,<br/>
			Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,<br/>
			When by a tumult we were overtaken,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00655">In the same way as he is who perceives<br/>
			The boar and chase approaching to his stand,<br/>
			Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00656">And two behold! upon our left-hand side,<br/>
			Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,<br/>
			That of the forest, every fan they broke.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00657">He who was in advance: "Now help, Death, help!"<br/>
			And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,<br/>
			Was shouting: "Lano, were not so alert<br/></p>
			<p id="id00658">Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!"<br/>
			And then, perchance because his breath was failing,<br/>
			He grouped himself together with a bush.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00659">Behind them was the forest full of black<br/>
			She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot<br/>
			As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00660">On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,<br/>
			And him they lacerated piece by piece,<br/>
			Thereafter bore away those aching members.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00661">Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,<br/>
			And led me to the bush, that all in vain<br/>
			Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00662">"O Jacopo," it said, "of Sant' Andrea,<br/>
			What helped it thee of me to make a screen?<br/>
			What blame have I in thy nefarious life?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00663">When near him had the Master stayed his steps,<br/>
			He said: "Who wast thou, that through wounds so many<br/>
			Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00664">And he to us: "O souls, that hither come<br/>
			To look upon the shameful massacre<br/>
			That has so rent away from me my leaves,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00665">Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;<br/>
			I of that city was which to the Baptist<br/>
			Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this<br/></p>
			<p id="id00666">Forever with his art will make it sad.<br/>
			And were it not that on the pass of Arno<br/>
			Some glimpses of him are remaining still,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00667">Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it<br/>
			Upon the ashes left by Attila,<br/>
			In vain had caused their labour to be done.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00668">Of my own house I made myself a gibbet."</p>
			<p id="id00669" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XIV</p>
			<p id="id00670" style="margin-top: 2em">Because the charity of my native place<br/>
			Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,<br/>
			And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00671">Then came we to the confine, where disparted<br/>
			The second round is from the third, and where<br/>
			A horrible form of Justice is beheld.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00672">Clearly to manifest these novel things,<br/>
			I say that we arrived upon a plain,<br/>
			Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00673">The dolorous forest is a garland to it<br/>
			All round about, as the sad moat to that;<br/>
			There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00674">The soil was of an arid and thick sand,<br/>
			Not of another fashion made than that<br/>
			Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00675">Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou<br/>
			By each one to be dreaded, who doth read<br/>
			That which was manifest unto mine eyes!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00676">Of naked souls beheld I many herds,<br/>
			Who all were weeping very miserably,<br/>
			And over them seemed set a law diverse.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00677">Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;<br/>
			And some were sitting all drawn up together,<br/>
			And others went about continually.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00678">Those who were going round were far the more,<br/>
			And those were less who lay down to their torment,<br/>
			But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00679">O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,<br/>
			Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,<br/>
			As of the snow on Alp without a wind.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00680">As Alexander, in those torrid parts<br/>
			Of India, beheld upon his host<br/>
			Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00681">Whence he provided with his phalanxes<br/>
			To trample down the soil, because the vapour<br/>
			Better extinguished was while it was single;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00682">Thus was descending the eternal heat,<br/>
			Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder<br/>
			Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00683">Without repose forever was the dance<br/>
			Of miserable hands, now there, now here,<br/>
			Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00684">"Master," began I, "thou who overcomest<br/>
			All things except the demons dire, that issued<br/>
			Against us at the entrance of the gate,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00685">Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not<br/>
			The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,<br/>
			So that the rain seems not to ripen him?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00686">And he himself, who had become aware<br/>
			That I was questioning my Guide about him,<br/>
			Cried: "Such as I was living, am I, dead.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00687">If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom<br/>
			He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,<br/>
			Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00688">And if he wearied out by turns the others<br/>
			In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,<br/>
			Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'<br/></p>
			<p id="id00689">Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,<br/>
			And shot his bolts at me with all his might,<br/>
			He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00690">Then did my Leader speak with such great force,<br/>
			That I had never heard him speak so loud:<br/>
			"O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished<br/></p>
			<p id="id00691">Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;<br/>
			Not any torment, saving thine own rage,<br/>
			Would be unto thy fury pain complete."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00692">Then he turned round to me with better lip,<br/>
			Saying: "One of the Seven Kings was he<br/>
			Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold<br/></p>
			<p id="id00693">God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;<br/>
			But, as I said to him, his own despites<br/>
			Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00694">Now follow me, and mind thou do not place<br/>
			As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,<br/>
			But always keep them close unto the wood."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00695">Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes<br/>
			Forth from the wood a little rivulet,<br/>
			Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00696">As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,<br/>
			The sinful women later share among them,<br/>
			So downward through the sand it went its way.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00697">The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,<br/>
			Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;<br/>
			Whence I perceived that there the passage was.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00698">"In all the rest which I have shown to thee<br/>
			Since we have entered in within the gate<br/>
			Whose threshold unto no one is denied,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00699">Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes<br/>
			So notable as is the present river,<br/>
			Which all the little flames above it quenches."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00700">These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him<br/>
			That he would give me largess of the food,<br/>
			For which he had given me largess of desire.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00701">"In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,"<br/>
			Said he thereafterward, "whose name is Crete,<br/>
			Under whose king the world of old was chaste.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00702">There is a mountain there, that once was glad<br/>
			With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;<br/>
			Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00703">Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle<br/>
			Of her own son; and to conceal him better,<br/>
			Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00704">A grand old man stands in the mount erect,<br/>
			Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta,<br/>
			And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00705">His head is fashioned of refined gold,<br/>
			And of pure silver are the arms and breast;<br/>
			Then he is brass as far down as the fork.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00706">From that point downward all is chosen iron,<br/>
			Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,<br/>
			And more he stands on that than on the other.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00707">Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure<br/>
			Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,<br/>
			Which gathered together perforate that cavern.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00708">From rock to rock they fall into this valley;<br/>
			Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;<br/>
			Then downward go along this narrow sluice<br/></p>
			<p id="id00709">Unto that point where is no more descending.<br/>
			They form Cocytus; what that pool may be<br/>
			Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00710">And I to him: "If so the present runnel<br/>
			Doth take its rise in this way from our world,<br/>
			Why only on this verge appears it to us?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00711">And he to me: "Thou knowest the place is round,<br/>
			And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,<br/>
			Still to the left descending to the bottom,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00712">Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.<br/>
			Therefore if something new appear to us,<br/>
			It should not bring amazement to thy face."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00713">And I again: "Master, where shall be found<br/>
			Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,<br/>
			And sayest the other of this rain is made?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00714">"In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,"<br/>
			Replied he; "but the boiling of the red<br/>
			Water might well solve one of them thou makest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00715">Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,<br/>
			There where the souls repair to lave themselves,<br/>
			When sin repented of has been removed."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00716">Then said he: "It is time now to abandon<br/>
			The wood; take heed that thou come after me;<br/>
			A way the margins make that are not burning,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00717">And over them all vapours are extinguished."</p>
			<p id="id00718" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XV</p>
			<p id="id00719" style="margin-top: 2em">Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,<br/>
			And so the brooklet's mist o'ershadows it,<br/>
			From fire it saves the water and the dikes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00720">Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges,<br/>
			Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself,<br/>
			Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00721">And as the Paduans along the Brenta,<br/>
			To guard their villas and their villages,<br/>
			Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00722">In such similitude had those been made,<br/>
			Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,<br/>
			Whoever he might be, the master made them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00723">Now were we from the forest so remote,<br/>
			I could not have discovered where it was,<br/>
			Even if backward I had turned myself,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00724">When we a company of souls encountered,<br/>
			Who came beside the dike, and every one<br/>
			Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont<br/></p>
			<p id="id00725">To eye each other under a new moon,<br/>
			And so towards us sharpened they their brows<br/>
			As an old tailor at the needle's eye.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00726">Thus scrutinised by such a family,<br/>
			By some one I was recognised, who seized<br/>
			My garment's hem, and cried out, "What a marvel!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00727">And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,<br/>
			On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,<br/>
			That the scorched countenance prevented not<br/></p>
			<p id="id00728">His recognition by my intellect;<br/>
			And bowing down my face unto his own,<br/>
			I made reply, "Are you here, Ser Brunetto?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00729">And he: "May't not displease thee, O my son,<br/>
			If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini<br/>
			Backward return and let the trail go on."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00730">I said to him: "With all my power I ask it;<br/>
			And if you wish me to sit down with you,<br/>
			I will, if he please, for I go with him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00731">"O son," he said, "whoever of this herd<br/>
			A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,<br/>
			Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00732">Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,<br/>
			And afterward will I rejoin my band,<br/>
			Which goes lamenting its eternal doom."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00733">I did not dare to go down from the road<br/>
			Level to walk with him; but my head bowed<br/>
			I held as one who goeth reverently.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00734">And he began: "What fortune or what fate<br/>
			Before the last day leadeth thee down here?<br/>
			And who is this that showeth thee the way?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00735">"Up there above us in the life serene,"<br/>
			I answered him, "I lost me in a valley,<br/>
			Or ever yet my age had been completed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00736">But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;<br/>
			This one appeared to me, returning thither,<br/>
			And homeward leadeth me along this road."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00737">And he to me: "If thou thy star do follow,<br/>
			Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,<br/>
			If well I judged in the life beautiful.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00738">And if I had not died so prematurely,<br/>
			Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,<br/>
			I would have given thee comfort in the work.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00739">But that ungrateful and malignant people,<br/>
			Which of old time from Fesole descended,<br/>
			And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00740">Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;<br/>
			And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs<br/>
			It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00741">Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;<br/>
			A people avaricious, envious, proud;<br/>
			Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00742">Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,<br/>
			One party and the other shall be hungry<br/>
			For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00743">Their litter let the beasts of Fesole<br/>
			Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,<br/>
			If any still upon their dunghill rise,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00744">In which may yet revive the consecrated<br/>
			Seed of those Romans, who remained there when<br/>
			The nest of such great malice it became."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00745">"If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,"<br/>
			Replied I to him, "not yet would you be<br/>
			In banishment from human nature placed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00746">For in my mind is fixed, and touches now<br/>
			My heart the dear and good paternal image<br/>
			Of you, when in the world from hour to hour<br/></p>
			<p id="id00747">You taught me how a man becomes eternal;<br/>
			And how much I am grateful, while I live<br/>
			Behoves that in my language be discerned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00748">What you narrate of my career I write,<br/>
			And keep it to be glossed with other text<br/>
			By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00749">This much will I have manifest to you;<br/>
			Provided that my conscience do not chide me,<br/>
			For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00750">Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;<br/>
			Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around<br/>
			As it may please her, and the churl his mattock."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00751">My Master thereupon on his right cheek<br/>
			Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;<br/>
			Then said: "He listeneth well who noteth it."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00752">Nor speaking less on that account, I go<br/>
			With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are<br/>
			His most known and most eminent companions.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00753">And he to me: "To know of some is well;<br/>
			Of others it were laudable to be silent,<br/>
			For short would be the time for so much speech.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00754">Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,<br/>
			And men of letters great and of great fame,<br/>
			In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00755">Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,<br/>
			And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there<br/>
			If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00756">That one, who by the Servant of the Servants<br/>
			From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,<br/>
			Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00757">More would I say, but coming and discoursing<br/>
			Can be no longer; for that I behold<br/>
			New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00758">A people comes with whom I may not be;<br/>
			Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,<br/>
			In which I still live, and no more I ask."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00759">Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those<br/>
			Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle<br/>
			Across the plain; and seemed to be among them<br/></p>
			<p id="id00760">The one who wins, and not the one who loses.</p>
			<p id="id00761" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XVI</p>
			<p id="id00762" style="margin-top: 2em">Now was I where was heard the reverberation<br/>
			Of water falling into the next round,<br/>
			Like to that humming which the beehives make,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00763">When shadows three together started forth,<br/>
			Running, from out a company that passed<br/>
			Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00764">Towards us came they, and each one cried out:<br/>
			"Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest<br/>

			<p id="id00765">Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,<br/>

			It pains me still but to remember it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00766">Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;<br/>
			He turned his face towards me, and "Now wait,"<br/>
			He said; "to these we should be courteous.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00767">And if it were not for the fire that darts<br/>

			<p id="id00768">As soon as we stood still, they recommenced<br/>
			The old refrain, and when they overtook us,<br/>
			Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00769">As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,<br/>
			Watching for their advantage and their hold,<br/>
			Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00770">Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage<br/>
			Direct to me, so that in opposite wise<br/>
			His neck and feet continual journey made.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00771">And, "If the misery of this soft place<br/>
			Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,"<br/>
			Began one, "and our aspect black and blistered,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00772">Let the renown of us thy mind incline<br/>
			To tell us who thou art, who thus securely<br/>
			Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00773">He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,<br/>
			Naked and skinless though he now may go,<br/>
			Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00774">He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;<br/>
			His name was Guidoguerra, and in life<br/>
			Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00775">The other, who close by me treads the sand,<br/>
			Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame<br/>
			Above there in the world should welcome be.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00776">And I, who with them on the cross am placed,<br/>
			Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly<br/>
			My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00777">Could I have been protected from the fire,<br/>
			Below I should have thrown myself among them,<br/>
			And think the Teacher would have suffered it;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00778">But as I should have burned and baked myself,<br/>
			My terror overmastered my good will,<br/>
			Which made me greedy of embracing them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00779">Then I began: "Sorrow and not disdain<br/>
			Did your condition fix within me so,<br/>
			That tardily it wholly is stripped off,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00780">As soon as this my Lord said unto me<br/>
			Words, on account of which I thought within me<br/>
			That people such as you are were approaching.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00781">I of your city am; and evermore<br/>
			Your labours and your honourable names<br/>
			I with affection have retraced and heard.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00782">I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits<br/>
			Promised to me by the veracious Leader;<br/>
			But to the centre first I needs must plunge."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00783">"So may the soul for a long while conduct<br/>
			Those limbs of thine," did he make answer then,<br/>
			"And so may thy renown shine after thee,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00784">Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell<br/>
			Within our city, as they used to do,<br/>
			Or if they wholly have gone out of it;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00785">For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment<br/>
			With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,<br/>
			Doth greatly mortify us with his words."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00786">"The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,<br/>
			Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,<br/>
			Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00787">In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;<br/>
			And the three, taking that for my reply,<br/>
			Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00788">"If other times so little it doth cost thee,"<br/>
			Replied they all, "to satisfy another,<br/>
			Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00789">Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,<br/>
			And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,<br/>
			When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'<br/></p>
			<p id="id00790">See that thou speak of us unto the people."<br/>
			Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight<br/>
			It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00791">Not an Amen could possibly be said<br/>
			So rapidly as they had disappeared;<br/>
			Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00792">I followed him, and little had we gone,<br/>
			Before the sound of water was so near us,<br/>
			That speaking we should hardly have been heard.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00793">Even as that stream which holdeth its own course<br/>
			The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,<br/>
			Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00794">Which is above called Acquacheta, ere<br/>
			It down descendeth into its low bed,<br/>
			And at Forli is vacant of that name,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00795">Reverberates there above San Benedetto<br/>
			From Alps, by falling at a single leap,<br/>
			Where for a thousand there were room enough;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00796">Thus downward from a bank precipitate,<br/>
			We found resounding that dark-tinted water,<br/>
			So that it soon the ear would have offended.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00797">I had a cord around about me girt,<br/>
			And therewithal I whilom had designed<br/>
			To take the panther with the painted skin.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00798">After I this had all from me unloosed,<br/>
			As my Conductor had commanded me,<br/>
			I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00799">Whereat he turned himself to the right side,<br/>
			And at a little distance from the verge,<br/>
			He cast it down into that deep abyss.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00800">"It must needs be some novelty respond,"<br/>
			I said within myself, "to the new signal<br/>
			The Master with his eye is following so."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00801">Ah me! how very cautious men should be<br/>
			With those who not alone behold the act,<br/>
			But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!<br/></p>
			<p id="id00802">He said to me: "Soon there will upward come<br/>
			What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming<br/>
			Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00803">Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,<br/>
			A man should close his lips as far as may be,<br/>
			Because without his fault it causes shame;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00804">But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes<br/>
			Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,<br/>
			So may they not be void of lasting favour,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00805">Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere<br/>
			I saw a figure swimming upward come,<br/>
			Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00806">Even as he returns who goeth down<br/>
			Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled<br/>
			Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00807">Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.</p>
			<p id="id00808" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XVII</p>
			<p id="id00809" style="margin-top: 2em">"Behold the monster with the pointed tail,<br/>
			Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,<br/>
			Behold him who infecteth all the world."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00810">Thus unto me my Guide began to say,<br/>
			And beckoned him that he should come to shore,<br/>
			Near to the confine of the trodden marble;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00811">And that uncleanly image of deceit<br/>
			Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,<br/>
			But on the border did not drag its tail.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00812">The face was as the face of a just man,<br/>
			Its semblance outwardly was so benign,<br/>
			And of a serpent all the trunk beside.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00813">Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;<br/>
			The back, and breast, and both the sides it had<br/>
			Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00814">With colours more, groundwork or broidery<br/>
			Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,<br/>
			Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00815">As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,<br/>
			That part are in the water, part on land;<br/>
			And as among the guzzling Germans there,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00816">The beaver plants himself to wage his war;<br/>
			So that vile monster lay upon the border,<br/>
			Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00817">His tail was wholly quivering in the void,<br/>
			Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,<br/>
			That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00818">The Guide said: "Now perforce must turn aside<br/>
			Our way a little, even to that beast<br/>
			Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00819">We therefore on the right side descended,<br/>
			And made ten steps upon the outer verge,<br/>
			Completely to avoid the sand and flame;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00820">And after we are come to him, I see<br/>
			A little farther off upon the sand<br/>
			A people sitting near the hollow place.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00821">Then said to me the Master: "So that full<br/>
			Experience of this round thou bear away,<br/>
			Now go and see what their condition is.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00822">There let thy conversation be concise;<br/>
			Till thou returnest I will speak with him,<br/>
			That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00823">Thus farther still upon the outermost<br/>
			Head of that seventh circle all alone<br/>
			I went, where sat the melancholy folk.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00824">Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;<br/>
			This way, that way, they helped them with their hands<br/>
			Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00825">Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,<br/>
			Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when<br/>
			By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00826">When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces<br/>
			Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,<br/>
			Not one of them I knew; but I perceived<br/></p>
			<p id="id00827">That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,<br/>
			Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;<br/>
			And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00828">And as I gazing round me come among them,<br/>
			Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw<br/>
			That had the face and posture of a lion.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00829">Proceeding then the current of my sight,<br/>
			Another of them saw I, red as blood,<br/>
			Display a goose more white than butter is.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00830">And one, who with an azure sow and gravid<br/>
			Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,<br/>
			Said unto me: "What dost thou in this moat?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00831">Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,<br/>
			Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,<br/>
			Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00832">A Paduan am I with these Florentines;<br/>
			Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,<br/>
			Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00833">He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'"<br/>
			Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust<br/>
			His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00834">And fearing lest my longer stay might vex<br/>
			Him who had warned me not to tarry long,<br/>
			Backward I turned me from those weary souls.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00835">I found my Guide, who had already mounted<br/>
			Upon the back of that wild animal,<br/>
			And said to me: "Now be both strong and bold.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00836">Now we descend by stairways such as these;<br/>
			Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,<br/>
			So that the tail may have no power to harm thee."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00837">Such as he is who has so near the ague<br/>
			Of quartan that his nails are blue already,<br/>
			And trembles all, but looking at the shade;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00838">Even such became I at those proffered words;<br/>
			But shame in me his menaces produced,<br/>
			Which maketh servant strong before good master.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00839">I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;<br/>
			I wished to say, and yet the voice came not<br/>
			As I believed, "Take heed that thou embrace me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00840">But he, who other times had rescued me<br/>
			In other peril, soon as I had mounted,<br/>
			Within his arms encircled and sustained me,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00841">And said: "Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;<br/>
			The circles large, and the descent be little;<br/>
			Think of the novel burden which thou hast."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00842">Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,<br/>
			Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;<br/>
			And when he wholly felt himself afloat,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00843">There where his breast had been he turned his tail,<br/>
			And that extended like an eel he moved,<br/>
			And with his paws drew to himself the air.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00844">A greater fear I do not think there was<br/>
			What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,<br/>
			Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00845">Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks<br/>
			Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,<br/>
			His father crying, "An ill way thou takest!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00846">Than was my own, when I perceived myself<br/>
			On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished<br/>
			The sight of everything but of the monster.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00847">Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;<br/>
			Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only<br/>
			By wind upon my face and from below.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00848">I heard already on the right the whirlpool<br/>
			Making a horrible crashing under us;<br/>
			Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00849">Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;<br/>
			Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,<br/>
			Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00850">I saw then, for before I had not seen it,<br/>
			The turning and descending, by great horrors<br/>
			That were approaching upon divers sides.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00851">As falcon who has long been on the wing,<br/>
			Who, without seeing either lure or bird,<br/>
			Maketh the falconer say, "Ah me, thou stoopest,"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00852">Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,<br/>
			Thorough a hundred circles, and alights<br/>
			Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00853">Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,<br/>
			Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,<br/>
			And being disencumbered of our persons,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00854">He sped away as arrow from the string.</p>
			<p id="id00855" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XVIII</p>
			<p id="id00856" style="margin-top: 2em">There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,<br/>
			Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,<br/>
			As is the circle that around it turns.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00857">Right in the middle of the field malign<br/>
			There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,<br/>
			Of which its place the structure will recount.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00858">Round, then, is that enclosure which remains<br/>
			Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,<br/>
			And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00859">As where for the protection of the walls<br/>
			Many and many moats surround the castles,<br/>
			The part in which they are a figure forms,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00860">Just such an image those presented there;<br/>
			And as about such strongholds from their gates<br/>
			Unto the outer bank are little bridges,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00861">So from the precipice's base did crags<br/>
			Project, which intersected dikes and moats,<br/>
			Unto the well that truncates and collects them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00862">Within this place, down shaken from the back<br/>
			Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet<br/>
			Held to the left, and I moved on behind.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00863">Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,<br/>
			New torments, and new wielders of the lash,<br/>
			Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00864">Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;<br/>
			This side the middle came they facing us,<br/>
			Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00865">Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,<br/>
			The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,<br/>
			Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00866">For all upon one side towards the Castle<br/>
			Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's;<br/>
			On the other side they go towards the Mountain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00867">This side and that, along the livid stone<br/>
			Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,<br/>
			Who cruelly were beating them behind.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00868">Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs<br/>
			At the first blows! and sooth not any one<br/>
			The second waited for, nor for the third.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00869">While I was going on, mine eyes by one<br/>
			Encountered were; and straight I said: "Already<br/>
			With sight of this one I am not unfed."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00870">Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,<br/>
			And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,<br/>
			And to my going somewhat back assented;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00871">And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,<br/>
			Lowering his face, but little it availed him;<br/>
			For said I: "Thou that castest down thine eyes,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00872">If false are not the features which thou bearest,<br/>
			Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;<br/>
			But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00873">And he to me: "Unwillingly I tell it;<br/>
			But forces me thine utterance distinct,<br/>
			Which makes me recollect the ancient world.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00874">I was the one who the fair Ghisola<br/>
			Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,<br/>
			Howe'er the shameless story may be told.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00875">Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;<br/>
			Nay, rather is this place so full of them,<br/>
			That not so many tongues to-day are taught<br/></p>
			<p id="id00876">'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'<br/>
			And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,<br/>
			Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00877">While speaking in this manner, with his scourge<br/>
			A demon smote him, and said: "Get thee gone<br/>
			Pander, there are no women here for coin."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00878">I joined myself again unto mine Escort;<br/>
			Thereafterward with footsteps few we came<br/>
			To where a crag projected from the bank.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00879">This very easily did we ascend,<br/>
			And turning to the right along its ridge,<br/>
			From those eternal circles we departed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00880">When we were there, where it is hollowed out<br/>
			Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,<br/>
			The Guide said: "Wait, and see that on thee strike<br/></p>
			<p id="id00881">The vision of those others evil-born,<br/>
			Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,<br/>
			Because together with us they have gone."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00882">From the old bridge we looked upon the train<br/>
			Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,<br/>
			And which the scourges in like manner smite.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00883">And the good Master, without my inquiring,<br/>
			Said to me: "See that tall one who is coming,<br/>
			And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00884">Still what a royal aspect he retains!<br/>
			That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning<br/>
			The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00885">He by the isle of Lemnos passed along<br/>
			After the daring women pitiless<br/>
			Had unto death devoted all their males.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00886">There with his tokens and with ornate words<br/>
			Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden<br/>
			Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00887">There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;<br/>
			Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,<br/>
			And also for Medea is vengeance done.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00888">With him go those who in such wise deceive;<br/>
			And this sufficient be of the first valley<br/>
			To know, and those that in its jaws it holds."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00889">We were already where the narrow path<br/>
			Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms<br/>
			Of that a buttress for another arch.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00890">Thence we heard people, who are making moan<br/>
			In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,<br/>
			And with their palms beating upon themselves<br/></p>
			<p id="id00891">The margins were incrusted with a mould<br/>
			By exhalation from below, that sticks there,<br/>
			And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00892">The bottom is so deep, no place suffices<br/>
			To give us sight of it, without ascending<br/>
			The arch's back, where most the crag impends.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00893">Thither we came, and thence down in the moat<br/>
			I saw a people smothered in a filth<br/>
			That out of human privies seemed to flow;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00894">And whilst below there with mine eye I search,<br/>
			I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,<br/>
			It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00895">He screamed to me: "Wherefore art thou so eager<br/>
			To look at me more than the other foul ones?"<br/>
			And I to him: "Because, if I remember,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00896">I have already seen thee with dry hair,<br/>
			And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;<br/>
			Therefore I eye thee more than all the others."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00897">And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:<br/>
			"The flatteries have submerged me here below,<br/>
			Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00898">Then said to me the Guide: "See that thou thrust<br/>
			Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,<br/>
			That with thine eyes thou well the face attain<br/></p>
			<p id="id00899">Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,<br/>
			Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,<br/>
			And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00900">Thais the harlot is it, who replied<br/>
			Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I<br/>

			<p id="id00911">In all of them the soles were both on fire;<br/>
			Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,<br/>
			They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00912">Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont<br/>
			To move upon the outer surface only,<br/>
			So likewise was it there from heel to point.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00913">"Master, who is that one who writhes himself,<br/>
			More than his other comrades quivering,"<br/>
			I said, "and whom a redder flame is sucking?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00914">And he to me: "If thou wilt have me bear thee<br/>
			Down there along that bank which lowest lies,<br/>
			From him thou'lt know his errors and himself."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00915">And I: "What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;<br/>
			Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not<br/>
			From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00916">Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;<br/>
			We turned, and on the left-hand side descended<br/>
			Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00917">And the good Master yet from off his haunch<br/>
			Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me<br/>
			Of him who so lamented with his shanks.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00918">"Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down,<br/>
			O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,"<br/>
			To say began I, "if thou canst, speak out."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00919">I stood even as the friar who is confessing<br/>
			The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,<br/>
			Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00920">And he cried out: "Dost thou stand there already,<br/>
			Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?<br/>
			By many years the record lied to me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00921">Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,<br/>
			For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud<br/>
			The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00922">Such I became, as people are who stand,<br/>
			Not comprehending what is answered them,<br/>
			As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00923">Then said Virgilius: "Say to him straightway,<br/>
			'I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.'"<br/>
			And I replied as was imposed on me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00924">Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,<br/>
			Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation<br/>
			Said to me: "Then what wantest thou of me?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00925">If who I am thou carest so much to know,<br/>
			That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,<br/>
			Know that I vested was with the great mantle;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00926">And truly was I son of the She-bear,<br/>
			So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth<br/>
			Above, and here myself, I pocketed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00927">Beneath my head the others are dragged down<br/>
			Who have preceded me in simony,<br/>
			Flattened along the fissure of the rock.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00928">Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever<br/>
			That one shall come who I believed thou wast,<br/>
			What time the sudden question I proposed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00929">But longer I my feet already toast,<br/>
			And here have been in this way upside down,<br/>
			Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00930">For after him shall come of fouler deed<br/>
			From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law,<br/>
			Such as befits to cover him and me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00931">New Jason will he be, of whom we read<br/>
			In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,<br/>
			So he who governs France shall be to this one."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00932">I do not know if I were here too bold,<br/>
			That him I answered only in this metre:<br/>
			"I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure<br/></p>
			<p id="id00933">Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,<br/>
			Before he put the keys into his keeping?<br/>
			Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'<br/></p>
			<p id="id00934">Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias<br/>
			Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen<br/>
			Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00935">Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,<br/>
			And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,<br/>
			Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00936">And were it not that still forbids it me<br/>
			The reverence for the keys superlative<br/>
			Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00937">I would make use of words more grievous still;<br/>
			Because your avarice afflicts the world,<br/>
			Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00938">The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,<br/>
			When she who sitteth upon many waters<br/>
			To fornicate with kings by him was seen;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00939">The same who with the seven heads was born,<br/>
			And power and strength from the ten horns received,<br/>
			So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00940">Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;<br/>
			And from the idolater how differ ye,<br/>
			Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?<br/></p>
			<p id="id00941">Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,<br/>
			Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower<br/>
			Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id00942">And while I sang to him such notes as these,<br/>
			Either that anger or that conscience stung him,<br/>
			He struggled violently with both his feet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00943">I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,<br/>
			With such contented lip he listened ever<br/>
			Unto the sound of the true words expressed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00944">Therefore with both his arms he took me up,<br/>
			And when he had me all upon his breast,<br/>
			Remounted by the way where he descended.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00945">Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;<br/>
			But bore me to the summit of the arch<br/>
			Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00946">There tenderly he laid his burden down,<br/>
			Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,<br/>
			That would have been hard passage for the goats:<br/></p>
			<p id="id00947">Thence was unveiled to me another valley.</p>

			<p id="id00950">I was already thoroughly disposed<br/>
			To peer down into the uncovered depth,<br/>
			Which bathed itself with tears of agony;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00951">And people saw I through the circular valley,<br/>

			<p id="id00957">Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak<br/>
			Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said<br/>
			To me: "Art thou, too, of the other fools?<br/></p>

			<p id="id00968">After her father had from life departed,<br/>

			In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,<br/>
			And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00976">Passing that way the virgin pitiless<br/>

			Untilled and naked of inhabitants;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00977">There to escape all human intercourse,<br/>

			<p id="id00982">And I: "My Master, thy discourses are<br/>

			<p id="id00984">Then said he to me: "He who from the cheek<br/>
			Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders<br/>
			Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00985">So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,<br/>

			<p id="id00986">Eryphylus his name was, and so sings<br/>
			My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;<br/>
			That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00987">The next, who is so slender in the flanks,<br/>
			Was Michael Scott, who of a verity<br/>
			Of magical illusions knew the game.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00988">Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,<br/>
			Who now unto his leather and his thread<br/>
			Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00989">Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,<br/>

			<p id="id00990">But come now, for already holds the confines<br/>

			<p id="id00991">And yesternight the moon was round already;<br/>
			Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee<br/>
			From time to time within the forest deep."<br/></p>
			<p id="id00992">Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.</p>
			<p id="id00993" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXI</p>
			<p id="id00994" style="margin-top: 2em">From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things<br/>
			Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,<br/>
			We came along, and held the summit, when<br/></p>
			<p id="id00995">We halted to behold another fissure<br/>
			Of Malebolge and other vain laments;<br/>
			And I beheld it marvellously dark.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00996">As in the Arsenal of the Venetians<br/>
			Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch<br/>
			To smear their unsound vessels o'er again,<br/></p>
			<p id="id00997">For sail they cannot; and instead thereof<br/>
			One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks<br/>
			The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00998">One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,<br/>
			This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,<br/>
			Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;<br/></p>
			<p id="id00999">Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,<br/>
			Was boiling down below there a dense pitch<br/>
			Which upon every side the bank belimed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01000">I saw it, but I did not see within it<br/>
			Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,<br/>
			And all swell up and resubside compressed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01001">The while below there fixedly I gazed,<br/>
			My Leader, crying out: "Beware, beware!"<br/>
			Drew me unto himself from where I stood.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01002">Then I turned round, as one who is impatient<br/>
			To see what it behoves him to escape,<br/>
			And whom a sudden terror doth unman,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01003">Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;<br/>
			And I beheld behind us a black devil,<br/>
			Running along upon the crag, approach.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01004">Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!<br/>
			And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,<br/>
			With open wings and light upon his feet!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01005">His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,<br/>
			A sinner did encumber with both haunches,<br/>
			And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01006">From off our bridge, he said: "O Malebranche,<br/>
			Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;<br/>
			Plunge him beneath, for I return for others<br/></p>
			<p id="id01007">Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.<br/>
			All there are barrators, except Bonturo;<br/>
			No into Yes for money there is changed."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01008">He hurled him down, and over the hard crag<br/>
			Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened<br/>
			In so much hurry to pursue a thief.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01009">The other sank, and rose again face downward;<br/>
			But the demons, under cover of the bridge,<br/>
			Cried: "Here the Santo Volto has no place!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01010">Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;<br/>
			Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,<br/>
			Do not uplift thyself above the pitch."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01011">They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;<br/>
			They said: "It here behoves thee to dance covered,<br/>
			That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01012">Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make<br/>
			Immerse into the middle of the caldron<br/>
			The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01013">Said the good Master to me: "That it be not<br/>
			Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down<br/>
			Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01014">And for no outrage that is done to me<br/>
			Be thou afraid, because these things I know,<br/>
			For once before was I in such a scuffle."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01015">Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head,<br/>
			And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,<br/>
			Need was for him to have a steadfast front.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01016">With the same fury, and the same uproar,<br/>
			As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,<br/>
			Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01017">They issued from beneath the little bridge,<br/>
			And turned against him all their grappling-irons;<br/>
			But he cried out: "Be none of you malignant!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01018">Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,<br/>
			Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,<br/>
			And then take counsel as to grappling me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01019">They all cried out: "Let Malacoda go;"<br/>
			Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,<br/>
			And he came to him, saying: "What avails it?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01020">"Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me<br/>
			Advanced into this place," my Master said,<br/>
			"Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01021">Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?<br/>
			Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed<br/>
			That I another show this savage road."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01022">Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,<br/>
			That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,<br/>
			And to the others said: "Now strike him not."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01023">And unto me my Guide: "O thou, who sittest<br/>
			Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,<br/>
			Securely now return to me again."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01024">Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;<br/>
			And all the devils forward thrust themselves,<br/>
			So that I feared they would not keep their compact.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01025">And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers<br/>
			Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,<br/>
			Seeing themselves among so many foes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01026">Close did I press myself with all my person<br/>
			Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes<br/>
			From off their countenance, which was not good.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01027">They lowered their rakes, and "Wilt thou have me hit him,"<br/>
			They said to one another, "on the rump?"<br/>
			And answered: "Yes; see that thou nick him with it."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01028">But the same demon who was holding parley<br/>
			With my Conductor turned him very quickly,<br/>
			And said: "Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01029">Then said to us: "You can no farther go<br/>
			Forward upon this crag, because is lying<br/>
			All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01030">And if it still doth please you to go onward,<br/>
			Pursue your way along upon this rock;<br/>
			Near is another crag that yields a path.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01031">Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,<br/>
			One thousand and two hundred sixty-six<br/>
			Years were complete, that here the way was broken.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01032">I send in that direction some of mine<br/>
			To see if any one doth air himself;<br/>
			Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01033">Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,"<br/>
			Began he to cry out, "and thou, Cagnazzo;<br/>
			And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01034">Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,<br/>
			And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,<br/>
			And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01035">Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;<br/>
			Let these be safe as far as the next crag,<br/>
			That all unbroken passes o'er the dens."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01036">"O me! what is it, Master, that I see?<br/>
			Pray let us go," I said, "without an escort,<br/>
			If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01037">If thou art as observant as thy wont is,<br/>
			Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,<br/>
			And with their brows are threatening woe to us?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01038">And he to me: "I will not have thee fear;<br/>
			Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,<br/>
			Because they do it for those boiling wretches."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01039">Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;<br/>
			But first had each one thrust his tongue between<br/>
			His teeth towards their leader for a signal;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01040">And he had made a trumpet of his rump.</p>
			<p id="id01041" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXII</p>
			<p id="id01042" style="margin-top: 2em">I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,<br/>

			<p id="id01043">Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,<br/>
			O Aretines, and foragers go forth,<br/>

			<p id="id01052">I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,<br/>
			One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass<br/>
			One frog remains, and down another dives;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01053">And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,<br/>
			Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,<br/>
			And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01054">I knew, before, the names of all of them,<br/>
			So had I noted them when they were chosen,<br/>
			And when they called each other, listened how.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01055">"O Rubicante, see that thou do lay<br/>
			Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,"<br/>
			Cried all together the accursed ones.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01056">And I: "My Master, see to it, if thou canst,<br/>
			That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,<br/>
			Thus come into his adversaries' hands."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01057">Near to the side of him my Leader drew,<br/>
			Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:<br/>
			"I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01058">My mother placed me servant to a lord,<br/>
			For she had borne me to a ribald knave,<br/>
			Destroyer of himself and of his things.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01059">Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;<br/>
			I set me there to practise barratry,<br/>
			For which I pay the reckoning in this heat."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01060">And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,<br/>
			On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,<br/>
			Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01061">Among malicious cats the mouse had come;<br/>
			But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,<br/>
			And said: "Stand ye aside, while I enfork him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01062">And to my Master he turned round his head;<br/>
			"Ask him again," he said, "if more thou wish<br/>
			To know from him, before some one destroy him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01063">The Guide: "Now tell then of the other culprits;<br/>
			Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,<br/>
			Under the pitch?"  And he: "I separated<br/></p>
			<p id="id01064">Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;<br/>
			Would that I still were covered up with him,<br/>
			For I should fear not either claw nor hook!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01065">And Libicocco: "We have borne too much;"<br/>
			And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,<br/>
			So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01066">Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him<br/>
			Down at the legs; whence their Decurion<br/>
			Turned round and round about with evil look.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01067">When they again somewhat were pacified,<br/>
			Of him, who still was looking at his wound,<br/>
			Demanded my Conductor without stay:<br/></p>
			<p id="id01068">"Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting<br/>
			Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?"<br/>
			And he replied: "It was the Friar Gomita,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01069">He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,<br/>
			Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,<br/>
			And dealt so with them each exults thereat;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01070">Money he took, and let them smoothly off,<br/>
			As he says; and in other offices<br/>
			A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01071">Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche<br/>
			Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia<br/>
			To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01072">O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;<br/>
			Still farther would I speak, but am afraid<br/>
			Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01073">And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,<br/>
			Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,<br/>
			Said: "Stand aside there, thou malicious bird."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01074">"If you desire either to see or hear,"<br/>
			The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,<br/>
			"Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01075">But let the Malebranche cease a little,<br/>
			So that these may not their revenges fear,<br/>
			And I, down sitting in this very place,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01076">For one that I am will make seven come,<br/>
			When I shall whistle, as our custom is<br/>
			To do whenever one of us comes out."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01077">Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,<br/>
			Shaking his head, and said: "Just hear the trick<br/>
			Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01078">Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,<br/>
			Responded: "I by far too cunning am,<br/>
			When I procure for mine a greater sadness."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01079">Alichin held not in, but running counter<br/>
			Unto the rest, said to him: "If thou dive,<br/>
			I will not follow thee upon the gallop,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01080">But I will beat my wings above the pitch;<br/>
			The height be left, and be the bank a shield<br/>
			To see if thou alone dost countervail us."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01081">O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!<br/>
			Each to the other side his eyes averted;<br/>
			He first, who most reluctant was to do it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01082">The Navarrese selected well his time;<br/>
			Planted his feet on land, and in a moment<br/>
			Leaped, and released himself from their design.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01083">Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,<br/>
			But he most who was cause of the defeat;<br/>
			Therefore he moved, and cried: "Thou art o'ertakern."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01084">But little it availed, for wings could not<br/>
			Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,<br/>
			And, flying, upward he his breast directed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01085">Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden<br/>
			Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,<br/>
			And upward he returneth cross and weary.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01086">Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina<br/>
			Flying behind him followed close, desirous<br/>
			The other should escape, to have a quarrel.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01087">And when the barrator had disappeared,<br/>
			He turned his talons upon his companion,<br/>
			And grappled with him right above the moat.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01088">But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk<br/>
			To clapperclaw him well; and both of them<br/>
			Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01089">A sudden intercessor was the heat;<br/>
			But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught,<br/>
			To such degree they had their wings belimed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01090">Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia<br/>
			Made four of them fly to the other side<br/>
			With all their gaffs, and very speedily<br/></p>
			<p id="id01091">This side and that they to their posts descended;<br/>
			They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,<br/>
			Who were already baked within the crust,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01092">And in this manner busied did we leave them.</p>
			<p id="id01093" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXIII</p>
			<p id="id01094" style="margin-top: 2em">Silent, alone, and without company<br/>
			We went, the one in front, the other after,<br/>
			As go the Minor Friars along their way.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01095">Upon the fable of Aesop was directed<br/>
			My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,<br/>
			Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01096">For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike<br/>
			Than this one is to that, if well we couple<br/>
			End and beginning with a steadfast mind.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01097">And even as one thought from another springs,<br/>
			So afterward from that was born another,<br/>
			Which the first fear within me double made.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01098">Thus did I ponder: "These on our account<br/>
			Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff<br/>
			So great, that much I think it must annoy them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01099">If anger be engrafted on ill-will,<br/>
			They will come after us more merciless<br/>
			Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01100">I felt my hair stand all on end already<br/>
			With terror, and stood backwardly intent,<br/>
			When said I: "Master, if thou hidest not<br/></p>
			<p id="id01101">Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche<br/>
			I am in dread; we have them now behind us;<br/>
			I so imagine them, I already feel them."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01102">And he: "If I were made of leaded glass,<br/>
			Thine outward image I should not attract<br/>
			Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01103">Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,<br/>
			With similar attitude and similar face,<br/>
			So that of both one counsel sole I made.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01104">If peradventure the right bank so slope<br/>
			That we to the next Bolgia can descend,<br/>
			We shall escape from the imagined chase."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01105">Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,<br/>
			When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,<br/>
			Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01106">My Leader on a sudden seized me up,<br/>
			Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,<br/>
			And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01107">Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,<br/>
			Having more care of him than of herself,<br/>
			So that she clothes her only with a shift;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01108">And downward from the top of the hard bank<br/>
			Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,<br/>
			That one side of the other Bolgia walls.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01109">Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice<br/>
			To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,<br/>
			When nearest to the paddles it approaches,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01110">As did my Master down along that border,<br/>
			Bearing me with him on his breast away,<br/>
			As his own son, and not as a companion.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01111">Hardly the bed of the ravine below<br/>
			His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill<br/>
			Right over us; but he was not afraid;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01112">For the high Providence, which had ordained<br/>
			To place them ministers of the fifth moat,<br/>
			The power of thence departing took from all.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01113">A painted people there below we found,<br/>
			Who went about with footsteps very slow,<br/>
			Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01114">They had on mantles with the hoods low down<br/>
			Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut<br/>
			That in Cologne they for the monks are made.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01115">Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;<br/>
			But inwardly all leaden and so heavy<br/>
			That Frederick used to put them on of straw.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01116">O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!<br/>
			Again we turned us, still to the left hand<br/>
			Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01117">But owing to the weight, that weary folk<br/>
			Came on so tardily, that we were new<br/>
			In company at each motion of the haunch.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01118">Whence I unto my Leader: "See thou find<br/>
			Some one who may by deed or name be known,<br/>
			And thus in going move thine eye about."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01119">And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,<br/>
			Cried to us from behind: "Stay ye your feet,<br/>
			Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01120">Perhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest."<br/>
			Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: "Wait,<br/>
			And then according to his pace proceed."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01121">I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste<br/>
			Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;<br/>
			But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01122">When they came up, long with an eye askance<br/>
			They scanned me without uttering a word.<br/>
			Then to each other turned, and said together:<br/></p>
			<p id="id01123">"He by the action of his throat seems living;<br/>
			And if they dead are, by what privilege<br/>
			Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01124">Then said to me: "Tuscan, who to the college<br/>
			Of miserable hypocrites art come,<br/>
			Do not disdain to tell us who thou art."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01125">And I to them: "Born was I, and grew up<br/>
			In the great town on the fair river of Arno,<br/>
			And with the body am I've always had.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01126">But who are ye, in whom there trickles down<br/>
			Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?<br/>
			And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01127">And one replied to me: "These orange cloaks<br/>
			Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights<br/>
			Cause in this way their balances to creak.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01128">Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;<br/>
			I Catalano, and he Loderingo<br/>
			Named, and together taken by thy city,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01129">As the wont is to take one man alone,<br/>
			For maintenance of its peace; and we were such<br/>
			That still it is apparent round Gardingo."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01130">"O Friars," began I, "your iniquitous. . ."<br/>
			But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed<br/>
			One crucified with three stakes on the ground.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01131">When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,<br/>
			Blowing into his beard with suspirations;<br/>
			And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01132">Said to me: "This transfixed one, whom thou seest,<br/>
			Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet<br/>
			To put one man to torture for the people.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01133">Crosswise and naked is he on the path,<br/>
			As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,<br/>
			Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01134">And in like mode his father-in-law is punished<br/>
			Within this moat, and the others of the council,<br/>
			Which for the Jews was a malignant seed."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01135">And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel<br/>
			O'er him who was extended on the cross<br/>
			So vilely in eternal banishment.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01136">Then he directed to the Friar this voice:<br/>
			"Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us<br/>
			If to the right hand any pass slope down<br/></p>
			<p id="id01137">By which we two may issue forth from here,<br/>
			Without constraining some of the black angels<br/>
			To come and extricate us from this deep."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01138">Then he made answer: "Nearer than thou hopest<br/>
			There is a rock, that forth from the great circle<br/>
			Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01139">Save that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it;<br/>
			You will be able to mount up the ruin,<br/>
			That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01140">The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;<br/>
			Then said: "The business badly he recounted<br/>
			Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01141">And the Friar: "Many of the Devil's vices<br/>
			Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,<br/>
			That he's a liar and the father of lies."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01142">Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,<br/>
			Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;<br/>
			Whence from the heavy-laden I departed<br/></p>
			<p id="id01143">After the prints of his beloved feet.</p>
			<p id="id01144" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXIV</p>
			<p id="id01145" style="margin-top: 2em">In that part of the youthful year wherein<br/>
			The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,<br/>
			And now the nights draw near to half the day,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01146">What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground<br/>
			The outward semblance of her sister white,<br/>
			But little lasts the temper of her pen,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01147">The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,<br/>
			Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign<br/>
			All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01148">Returns in doors, and up and down laments,<br/>
			Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;<br/>
			Then he returns and hope revives again,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01149">Seeing the world has changed its countenance<br/>
			In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,<br/>
			And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01150">Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,<br/>
			When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,<br/>
			And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01151">For as we came unto the ruined bridge,<br/>
			The Leader turned to me with that sweet look<br/>
			Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01152">His arms he opened, after some advisement<br/>
			Within himself elected, looking first<br/>
			Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01153">And even as he who acts and meditates,<br/>
			For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,<br/>
			So upward lifting me towards the summit<br/></p>
			<p id="id01154">Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,<br/>
			Saying: "To that one grapple afterwards,<br/>
			But try first if 'tis such that it will hold thee."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01155">This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;<br/>
			For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,<br/>
			Were able to ascend from jag to jag.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01156">And had it not been, that upon that precinct<br/>
			Shorter was the ascent than on the other,<br/>
			He I know not, but I had been dead beat.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01157">But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth<br/>
			Of the profoundest well is all inclining,<br/>
			The structure of each valley doth import<br/></p>
			<p id="id01158">That one bank rises and the other sinks.<br/>
			Still we arrived at length upon the point<br/>
			Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01159">The breath was from my lungs so milked away,<br/>
			When I was up, that I could go no farther,<br/>
			Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01160">"Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,"<br/>
			My Master said; "for sitting upon down,<br/>
			Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01161">Withouten which whoso his life consumes<br/>
			Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,<br/>
			As smoke in air or in the water foam.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01162">And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish<br/>
			With spirit that o'ercometh every battle,<br/>
			If with its heavy body it sink not.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01163">A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;<br/>
			'Tis not enough from these to have departed;<br/>
			Let it avail thee, if thou understand me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01164">Then I uprose, showing myself provided<br/>
			Better with breath than I did feel myself,<br/>
			And said: "Go on, for I am strong and bold."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01165">Upward we took our way along the crag,<br/>
			Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,<br/>
			And more precipitous far than that before.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01166">Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;<br/>
			Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,<br/>
			Not well adapted to articulate words.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01167">I know not what it said, though o'er the back<br/>
			I now was of the arch that passes there;<br/>
			But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01168">I was bent downward, but my living eyes<br/>
			Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;<br/>
			Wherefore I: "Master, see that thou arrive<br/></p>
			<p id="id01169">At the next round, and let us descend the wall;<br/>
			For as from hence I hear and understand not,<br/>
			So I look down and nothing I distinguish."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01170">"Other response," he said, "I make thee not,<br/>
			Except the doing; for the modest asking<br/>
			Ought to be followed by the deed in silence."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01171">We from the bridge descended at its head,<br/>
			Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,<br/>
			And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01172">And I beheld therein a terrible throng<br/>
			Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,<br/>
			That the remembrance still congeals my blood<br/></p>
			<p id="id01173">Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;<br/>
			For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae<br/>
			She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01174">Neither so many plagues nor so malignant<br/>
			E'er showed she with all Ethiopia,<br/>
			Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01175">Among this cruel and most dismal throng<br/>
			People were running naked and affrighted.<br/>
			Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01176">They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;<br/>
			These riveted upon their reins the tail<br/>
			And head, and were in front of them entwined.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01177">And lo! at one who was upon our side<br/>
			There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him<br/>
			There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01178">Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,<br/>
			As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly<br/>
			Behoved it that in falling he became.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01179">And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,<br/>
			The ashes drew together, and of themselves<br/>
			Into himself they instantly returned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01180">Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed<br/>
			The phoenix dies, and then is born again,<br/>
			When it approaches its five-hundredth year;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01181">On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,<br/>
			But only on tears of incense and amomum,<br/>
			And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01182">And as he is who falls, and knows not how,<br/>
			By force of demons who to earth down drag him,<br/>
			Or other oppilation that binds man,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01183">When he arises and around him looks,<br/>
			Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish<br/>
			Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01184">Such was that sinner after he had risen.<br/>
			Justice of God! O how severe it is,<br/>
			That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01185">The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;<br/>
			Whence he replied: "I rained from Tuscany<br/>
			A short time since into this cruel gorge.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01186">A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,<br/>
			Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci,<br/>
			Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01187">And I unto the Guide: "Tell him to stir not,<br/>
			And ask what crime has thrust him here below,<br/>
			For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01188">And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,<br/>
			But unto me directed mind and face,<br/>
			And with a melancholy shame was painted.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01189">Then said: "It pains me more that thou hast caught me<br/>
			Amid this misery where thou seest me,<br/>
			Than when I from the other life was taken.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01190">What thou demandest I cannot deny;<br/>
			So low am I put down because I robbed<br/>
			The sacristy of the fair ornaments,<br/></p>

			<p id="id01198">From that time forth the serpents were my friends;<br/>

			As if it said: "I will not thou speak more;"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01199">And round his arms another, and rebound him,<br/>

			<p id="id01201">Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,<br/>
			Spirit I saw not against God so proud,<br/>
			Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01202">He fled away, and spake no further word;<br/>
			And I beheld a Centaur full of rage<br/>
			Come crying out: "Where is, where is the scoffer?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01203">I do not think Maremma has so many<br/>
			Serpents as he had all along his back,<br/>
			As far as where our countenance begins.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01204">Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,<br/>
			With wings wide open was a dragon lying,<br/>
			And he sets fire to all that he encounters.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01205">My Master said: "That one is Cacus, who<br/>
			Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine<br/>
			Created oftentimes a lake of blood.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01206">He goes not on the same road with his brothers,<br/>
			By reason of the fraudulent theft he made<br/>

			<p id="id01207">Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath<br/>
			The mace of Hercules, who peradventure<br/>
			Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01208">While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,<br/>
			And spirits three had underneath us come,<br/>
			Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01209">Until what time they shouted: "Who are you?"<br/>
			On which account our story made a halt,<br/>
			And then we were intent on them alone.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01210">I did not know them; but it came to pass,<br/>
			As it is wont to happen by some chance,<br/>
			That one to name the other was compelled,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01211">Exclaiming: "Where can Cianfa have remained?"<br/>
			Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,<br/>
			Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01212">If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe<br/>
			What I shall say, it will no marvel be,<br/>
			For I who saw it hardly can admit it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01213">As I was holding raised on them my brows,<br/>
			Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth<br/>
			In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01214">With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,<br/>
			And with the forward ones his arms it seized;<br/>
			Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01215">The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,<br/>
			And put its tail through in between the two,<br/>
			And up behind along the reins outspread it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01216">Ivy was never fastened by its barbs<br/>
			Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile<br/>
			Upon the other's limbs entwined its own.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01217">Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax<br/>
			They had been made, and intermixed their colour;<br/>
			Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01218">E'en as proceedeth on before the flame<br/>
			Upward along the paper a brown colour,<br/>
			Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01219">The other two looked on, and each of them<br/>
			Cried out: "O me, Agnello, how thou changest!<br/>
			Behold, thou now art neither two nor one."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01220">Already the two heads had one become,<br/>
			When there appeared to us two figures mingled<br/>
			Into one face, wherein the two were lost.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01221">Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,<br/>
			The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest<br/>
			Members became that never yet were seen.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01222">Every original aspect there was cancelled;<br/>
			Two and yet none did the perverted image<br/>
			Appear, and such departed with slow pace.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01223">Even as a lizard, under the great scourge<br/>
			Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,<br/>
			Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01224">Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies<br/>
			Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,<br/>
			Livid and black as is a peppercorn.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01225">And in that part whereat is first received<br/>
			Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;<br/>
			Then downward fell in front of him extended.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01226">The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;<br/>
			Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,<br/>
			Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01227">He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;<br/>
			One through the wound, the other through the mouth<br/>
			Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01228">Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions<br/>
			Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,<br/>
			And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01229">Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;<br/>
			For if him to a snake, her to fountain,<br/>
			Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01230">Because two natures never front to front<br/>
			Has he transmuted, so that both the forms<br/>
			To interchange their matter ready were.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01231">Together they responded in such wise,<br/>
			That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,<br/>
			And eke the wounded drew his feet together.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01232">The legs together with the thighs themselves<br/>
			Adhered so, that in little time the juncture<br/>
			No sign whatever made that was apparent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01233">He with the cloven tail assumed the figure<br/>
			The other one was losing, and his skin<br/>
			Became elastic, and the other's hard.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01234">I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,<br/>
			And both feet of the reptile, that were short,<br/>
			Lengthen as much as those contracted were.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01235">Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,<br/>
			Became the member that a man conceals,<br/>
			And of his own the wretch had two created.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01236">While both of them the exhalation veils<br/>
			With a new colour, and engenders hair<br/>
			On one of them and depilates the other,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01237">The one uprose and down the other fell,<br/>
			Though turning not away their impious lamps,<br/>
			Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01238">He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,<br/>
			And from excess of matter, which came thither,<br/>
			Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01239">What did not backward run and was retained<br/>
			Of that excess made to the face a nose,<br/>
			And the lips thickened far as was befitting.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01240">He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,<br/>
			And backward draws the ears into his head,<br/>
			In the same manner as the snail its horns;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01241">And so the tongue, which was entire and apt<br/>
			For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked<br/>
			In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01242">The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,<br/>
			Along the valley hissing takes to flight,<br/>
			And after him the other speaking sputters.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01243">Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,<br/>
			And said to the other: "I'll have Buoso run,<br/>
			Crawling as I have done, along this road."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01244">In this way I beheld the seventh ballast<br/>
			Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse<br/>
			The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01245">And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be<br/>
			Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,<br/>
			They could not flee away so secretly<br/></p>
			<p id="id01246">But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;<br/>
			And he it was who sole of three companions,<br/>
			Which came in the beginning, was not changed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01247">The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.</p>
			<p id="id01248" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXVI</p>
			<p id="id01249" style="margin-top: 2em">Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,<br/>

			Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,<br/>
			And thou thereby to no great honour risest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01251">But if when morn is near our dreams are true,<br/>
			Feel shalt thou in a little time from now<br/>
			What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01252">And if it now were, it were not too soon;<br/>
			Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,<br/>
			For 'twill aggrieve me more the more I age.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01253">We went our way, and up along the stairs<br/>
			The bourns had made us to descend before,<br/>
			Remounted my Conductor and drew me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01254">And following the solitary path<br/>
			Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,<br/>
			The foot without the hand sped not at all.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01255">Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,<br/>

			<p id="id01256">That it may run not unless virtue guide it;<br/>
			So that if some good star, or better thing,<br/>
			Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01257">As many as the hind (who on the hill<br/>
			Rests at the time when he who lights the world<br/>
			His countenance keeps least concealed from us,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01258">While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)<br/>
			Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,<br/>
			Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01259">With flames as manifold resplendent all<br/>
			Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware<br/>
			As soon as I was where the depth appeared.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01260">And such as he who with the bears avenged him<br/>
			Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,<br/>
			What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01261">For with his eye he could not follow it<br/>
			So as to see aught else than flame alone,<br/>
			Even as a little cloud ascending upward,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01262">Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment<br/>
			Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,<br/>
			And every flame a sinner steals away.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01263">I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,<br/>
			So that, if I had seized not on a rock,<br/>
			Down had I fallen without being pushed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01264">And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,<br/>
			Exclaimed: "Within the fires the spirits are;<br/>
			Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01265">"My Master," I replied, "by hearing thee<br/>
			I am more sure; but I surmised already<br/>
			It might be so, and already wished to ask thee<br/></p>
			<p id="id01266">Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft<br/>
			At top, it seems uprising from the pyre<br/>
			Where was Eteocles with his brother placed."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01267">He answered me: "Within there are tormented<br/>
			Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together<br/>
			They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01268">And there within their flame do they lament<br/>
			The ambush of the horse, which made the door<br/>
			Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01269">Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead<br/>
			Deidamia still deplores Achilles,<br/>
			And pain for the Palladium there is borne."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01270">"If they within those sparks possess the power<br/>
			To speak," I said, "thee, Master, much I pray,<br/>
			And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01271">That thou make no denial of awaiting<br/>
			Until the horned flame shall hither come;<br/>
			Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01272">And he to me: "Worthy is thy entreaty<br/>
			Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;<br/>
			But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01273">Leave me to speak, because I have conceived<br/>
			That which thou wishest; for they might disdain<br/>
			Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01274">When now the flame had come unto that point,<br/>
			Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,<br/>
			After this fashion did I hear him speak:<br/></p>
			<p id="id01275">"O ye, who are twofold within one fire,<br/>
			If I deserved of you, while I was living,<br/>
			If I deserved of you or much or little<br/></p>
			<p id="id01276">When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,<br/>
			Do not move on, but one of you declare<br/>
			Whither, being lost, he went away to die."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01277">Then of the antique flame the greater horn,<br/>
			Murmuring, began to wave itself about<br/>
			Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01278">Thereafterward, the summit to and fro<br/>
			Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,<br/>
			It uttered forth a voice, and said: "When I<br/></p>
			<p id="id01279">From Circe had departed, who concealed me<br/>
			More than a year there near unto Gaeta,<br/>
			Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01280">Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence<br/>
			For my old father, nor the due affection<br/>
			Which joyous should have made Penelope,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01281">Could overcome within me the desire<br/>
			I had to be experienced of the world,<br/>
			And of the vice and virtue of mankind;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01282">But I put forth on the high open sea<br/>
			With one sole ship, and that small company<br/>
			By which I never had deserted been.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01283">Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,<br/>
			Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,<br/>
			And the others which that sea bathes round about.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01284">I and my company were old and slow<br/>
			When at that narrow passage we arrived<br/>
			Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01285">That man no farther onward should adventure.<br/>
			On the right hand behind me left I Seville,<br/>
			And on the other already had left Ceuta.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01286">'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand<br/>
			Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,<br/>
			To this so inconsiderable vigil<br/></p>
			<p id="id01287">Which is remaining of your senses still<br/>
			Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,<br/>
			Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01288">Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;<br/>
			Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,<br/>
			But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'<br/></p>
			<p id="id01289">So eager did I render my companions,<br/>
			With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,<br/>
			That then I hardly could have held them back.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01290">And having turned our stern unto the morning,<br/>
			We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,<br/>
			Evermore gaining on the larboard side.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01291">Already all the stars of the other pole<br/>
			The night beheld, and ours so very low<br/>
			It did not rise above the ocean floor.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01292">Five times rekindled and as many quenched<br/>
			Had been the splendour underneath the moon,<br/>
			Since we had entered into the deep pass,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01293">When there appeared to us a mountain, dim<br/>
			From distance, and it seemed to me so high<br/>
			As I had never any one beheld.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01294">Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;<br/>
			For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,<br/>
			And smote upon the fore part of the ship.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01295">Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,<br/>
			At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,<br/>
			And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01296">Until the sea above us closed again."</p>
			<p id="id01297" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXVII</p>
			<p id="id01298" style="margin-top: 2em">Already was the flame erect and quiet,<br/>
			To speak no more, and now departed from us<br/>
			With the permission of the gentle Poet;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01299">When yet another, which behind it came,<br/>
			Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top<br/>
			By a confused sound that issued from it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01300">As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first<br/>

			<p id="id01302">Thus, by not having any way or issue<br/>
			At first from out the fire, to its own language<br/>
			Converted were the melancholy words.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01303">But afterwards, when they had gathered way<br/>
			Up through the point, giving it that vibration<br/>
			The tongue had given them in their passage out,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01304">We heard it said: "O thou, at whom I aim<br/>

			Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'<br/></p>
			<p id="id01305">Because I come perchance a little late,<br/>
			To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;<br/>
			Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01306">If thou but lately into this blind world<br/>

			For I was from the mountains there between<br/>
			Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01308">I still was downward bent and listening,<br/>
			When my Conductor touched me on the side,<br/>
			Saying: "Speak thou: this one a Latian is."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01309">And I, who had beforehand my reply<br/>
			In readiness, forthwith began to speak:<br/>
			"O soul, that down below there art concealed,<br/></p>

			But open war I none have left there now.<br/></p>

			The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,<br/>
			So that she covers Cervia with her vans.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01312">The city which once made the long resistance,<br/>
			And of the French a sanguinary heap,<br/>
			Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01313">Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new,<br/>

			Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01314">The cities of Lamone and Santerno<br/>
			Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,<br/>
			Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01315">And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,<br/>
			Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,<br/>
			Lives between tyranny and a free state.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01316">Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;<br/>
			Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,<br/>
			So may thy name hold front there in the world."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01317">After the fire a little more had roared<br/>
			In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved<br/>
			This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:<br/></p>
			<p id="id01318">"If I believed that my reply were made<br/>
			To one who to the world would e'er return,<br/>
			This flame without more flickering would stand still;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01319">But inasmuch as never from this depth<br/>
			Did any one return, if I hear true,<br/>
			Without the fear of infamy I answer,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01320">I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,<br/>

			And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01322">While I was still the form of bone and pulp<br/>

			<p id="id01324">When now unto that portion of mine age<br/>
			I saw myself arrived, when each one ought<br/>
			To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01325">That which before had pleased me then displeased me;<br/>

			<p id="id01333">Then urged me on his weighty arguments<br/>

			<p id="id01338">O miserable me! how I did shudder<br/>
			When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure<br/>

			<p id="id01339">He bore me unto Minos, who entwined<br/>
			Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,<br/>

			<p id="id01340">Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'<br/>

			<p id="id01400">I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,<br/>
			I think a spirit of my blood laments<br/>
			The sin which down below there costs so much."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01401">Then said the Master: "Be no longer broken<br/>

			<p id="id01402">For him I saw below the little bridge,<br/>

			<p id="id01403">So wholly at that time wast thou impeded<br/>

			Down to the bottom, if there were more light.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01407">When we were now right over the last cloister<br/>

			<p id="id01408">Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,<br/>

			<p id="id01411">We had descended on the furthest bank<br/>
			From the long crag, upon the left hand still,<br/>

			<p id="id01412">Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress<br/>

			The spirits languishing in divers heaps.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01416">This on the belly, that upon the back<br/>
			One of the other lay, and others crawling<br/>
			Shifted themselves along the dismal road.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01417">We step by step went onward without speech,<br/>
			Gazing upon and listening to the sick<br/>
			Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01418">I saw two sitting leaned against each other,<br/>
			As leans in heating platter against platter,<br/>
			From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01419">And never saw I plied a currycomb<br/>

			Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01420">As every one was plying fast the bite<br/>
			Of nails upon himself, for the great rage<br/>
			Of itching which no other succour had.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01421">And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,<br/>
			In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,<br/>
			Or any other fish that has them largest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01422">"O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,"<br/>
			Began my Leader unto one of them,<br/>
			"And makest of them pincers now and then,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01423">Tell me if any Latian is with those<br/>
			Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee<br/>
			To all eternity unto this work."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01424">"Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,<br/>
			Both of us here," one weeping made reply;<br/>
			"But who art thou, that questionest about us?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01425">And said the Guide: "One am I who descends<br/>
			Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,<br/>
			And I intend to show Hell unto him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01426">Then broken was their mutual support,<br/>
			And trembling each one turned himself to me,<br/>
			With others who had heard him by rebound.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01427">Wholly to me did the good Master gather,<br/>
			Saying: "Say unto them whate'er thou wishest."<br/>
			And I began, since he would have it so:<br/></p>
			<p id="id01428">"So may your memory not steal away<br/>
			In the first world from out the minds of men,<br/>
			But so may it survive 'neath many suns,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01429">Say to me who ye are, and of what people;<br/>
			Let not your foul and loathsome punishment<br/>
			Make you afraid to show yourselves to me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01430">"I of Arezzo was," one made reply,<br/>
			"And Albert of Siena had me burned;<br/>
			But what I died for does not bring me here.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01431">'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,<br/>
			That I could rise by flight into the air,<br/>
			And he who had conceit, but little wit,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01432">Would have me show to him the art; and only<br/>
			Because no Daedalus I made him, made me<br/>
			Be burned by one who held him as his son.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01433">But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,<br/>
			For alchemy, which in the world I practised,<br/>
			Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01434">And to the Poet said I: "Now was ever<br/>
			So vain a people as the Sienese?<br/>
			Not for a certainty the French by far."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01435">Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,<br/>
			Replied unto my speech: "Taking out Stricca,<br/>
			Who knew the art of moderate expenses,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01436">And Niccolo, who the luxurious use<br/>
			Of cloves discovered earliest of all<br/>

			<p id="id01476">It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;<br/>
			And Master Adam smote him in the face,<br/>
			With arm that did not seem to be less hard,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01477">Saying to him: "Although be taken from me<br/>
			All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,<br/>
			I have an arm unfettered for such need."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01478">Whereat he answer made: "When thou didst go<br/>
			Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:<br/>
			But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01479">The dropsical: "Thou sayest true in that;<br/>
			But thou wast not so true a witness there,<br/>
			Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01480">"If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,"<br/>
			Said Sinon; "and for one fault I am here,<br/>
			And thou for more than any other demon."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01481">"Remember, perjurer, about the horse,"<br/>
			He made reply who had the swollen belly,<br/>
			"And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01482">"Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks<br/>
			Thy tongue," the Greek said, "and the putrid water<br/>
			That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01483">Then the false-coiner: "So is gaping wide<br/>
			Thy mouth for speaking evil, as 'tis wont;<br/>
			Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me<br/></p>
			<p id="id01484">Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,<br/>
			And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus<br/>
			Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01485">In listening to them was I wholly fixed,<br/>
			When said the Master to me: "Now just look,<br/>
			For little wants it that I quarrel with thee."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01486">When him I heard in anger speak to me,<br/>
			I turned me round towards him with such shame<br/>
			That still it eddies through my memory.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01487">And as he is who dreams of his own harm,<br/>
			Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,<br/>
			So that he craves what is, as if it were not;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01488">Such I became, not having power to speak,<br/>
			For to excuse myself I wished, and still<br/>
			Excused myself, and did not think I did it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01489">"Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,"<br/>
			The Master said, "than this of thine has been;<br/>
			Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01490">And make account that I am aye beside thee,<br/>
			If e'er it come to pass that fortune bring thee<br/>
			Where there are people in a like dispute;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01491">For a base wish it is to wish to hear it."</p>
			<p id="id01492" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXXI</p>
			<p id="id01493" style="margin-top: 2em">One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,<br/>
			So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,<br/>
			And then held out to me the medicine;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01494">Thus do I hear that once Achilles' spear,<br/>
			His and his father's, used to be the cause<br/>
			First of a sad and then a gracious boon.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01495">We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,<br/>
			Upon the bank that girds it round about,<br/>
			Going across it without any speech.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01496">There it was less than night, and less than day,<br/>
			So that my sight went little in advance;<br/>
			But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01497">So loud it would have made each thunder faint,<br/>
			Which, counter to it following its way,<br/>
			Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01498">After the dolorous discomfiture<br/>
			When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,<br/>
			So terribly Orlando sounded not.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01499">Short while my head turned thitherward I held<br/>
			When many lofty towers I seemed to see,<br/>
			Whereat I: "Master, say, what town is this?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01500">And he to me: "Because thou peerest forth<br/>
			Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,<br/>
			It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01501">Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,<br/>
			How much the sense deceives itself by distance;<br/>
			Therefore a little faster spur thee on."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01502">Then tenderly he took me by the hand,<br/>
			And said: "Before we farther have advanced,<br/>
			That the reality may seem to thee<br/></p>
			<p id="id01503">Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,<br/>
			And they are in the well, around the bank,<br/>
			From navel downward, one and all of them."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01504">As, when the fog is vanishing away,<br/>
			Little by little doth the sight refigure<br/>
			Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01505">So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,<br/>
			More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge,<br/>
			My error fled, and fear came over me;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01506">Because as on its circular parapets<br/>
			Montereggione crowns itself with towers,<br/>
			E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well<br/></p>
			<p id="id01507">With one half of their bodies turreted<br/>
			The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces<br/>
			E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01508">And I of one already saw the face,<br/>
			Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,<br/>
			And down along his sides both of the arms.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01509">Certainly Nature, when she left the making<br/>
			Of animals like these, did well indeed,<br/>
			By taking such executors from Mars;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01510">And if of elephants and whales she doth not<br/>
			Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly<br/>
			More just and more discreet will hold her for it;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01511">For where the argument of intellect<br/>
			Is added unto evil will and power,<br/>
			No rampart can the people make against it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01512">His face appeared to me as long and large<br/>
			As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's,<br/>
			And in proportion were the other bones;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01513">So that the margin, which an apron was<br/>
			Down from the middle, showed so much of him<br/>
			Above it, that to reach up to his hair<br/></p>
			<p id="id01514">Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;<br/>
			For I beheld thirty great palms of him<br/>
			Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01515">"Raphael mai amech izabi almi,"<br/>
			Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,<br/>
			To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01516">And unto him my Guide: "Soul idiotic,<br/>
			Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,<br/>
			When wrath or other passion touches thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01517">Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt<br/>
			Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,<br/>
			And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01518">Then said to me: "He doth himself accuse;<br/>
			This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought<br/>
			One language in the world is not still used.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01519">Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;<br/>
			For even such to him is every language<br/>
			As his to others, which to none is known."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01520">Therefore a longer journey did we make,<br/>
			Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft<br/>
			We found another far more fierce and large.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01521">In binding him, who might the master be<br/>
			I cannot say; but he had pinioned close<br/>
			Behind the right arm, and in front the other,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01522">With chains, that held him so begirt about<br/>
			From the neck down, that on the part uncovered<br/>
			It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01523">"This proud one wished to make experiment<br/>
			Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,"<br/>
			My Leader said, "whence he has such a guerdon.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01524">Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.<br/>
			What time the giants terrified the gods;<br/>
			The arms he wielded never more he moves."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01525">And I to him: "If possible, I should wish<br/>
			That of the measureless Briareus<br/>
			These eyes of mine might have experience."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01526">Whence he replied: "Thou shalt behold Antaeus<br/>
			Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,<br/>
			Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01527">Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,<br/>
			And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,<br/>
			Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01528">There never was an earthquake of such might<br/>
			That it could shake a tower so violently,<br/>
			As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01529">Then was I more afraid of death than ever,<br/>
			For nothing more was needful than the fear,<br/>
			If I had not beheld the manacles.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01530">Then we proceeded farther in advance,<br/>
			And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells<br/>
			Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01531">"O thou, who in the valley fortunate,<br/>
			Which Scipio the heir of glory made,<br/>
			When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01532">Once brought'st a thousand lions for thy prey,<br/>
			And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war<br/>
			Among thy brothers, some it seems still think<br/></p>
			<p id="id01533">The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:<br/>
			Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,<br/>
			There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01534">Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;<br/>
			This one can give of that which here is longed for;<br/>
			Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01535">Still in the world can he restore thy fame;<br/>
			Because he lives, and still expects long life,<br/>
			If to itself Grace call him not untimely."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01536">So said the Master; and in haste the other<br/>
			His hands extended and took up my Guide,—<br/>
			Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01537">Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,<br/>
			Said unto me: "Draw nigh, that I may take thee;"<br/>
			Then of himself and me one bundle made.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01538">As seems the Carisenda, to behold<br/>
			Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud<br/>
			Above it so that opposite it hangs;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01539">Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood<br/>
			Watching to see him stoop, and then it was<br/>
			I could have wished to go some other way.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01540">But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up<br/>
			Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;<br/>
			Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01541">But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.</p>
			<p id="id01542" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXXII</p>
			<p id="id01543" style="margin-top: 2em">If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,<br/>

			<p id="id01544">I would press out the juice of my conception<br/>
			More fully; but because I have them not,<br/>
			Not without fear I bring myself to speak;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01545">For 'tis no enterprise to take in jest,<br/>

			<p id="id01548">When we were down within the darksome well,<br/>
			Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far,<br/>
			And I was scanning still the lofty wall,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01549">I heard it said to me: "Look how thou steppest!<br/>
			Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet<br/>
			The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01550">Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me<br/>
			And underfoot a lake, that from the frost<br/>
			The semblance had of glass, and not of water.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01551">So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current<br/>
			In winter-time Danube in Austria,<br/>
			Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01552">As there was here; so that if Tambernich<br/>
			Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,<br/>
			E'en at the edge 'twould not have given a creak.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01553">And as to croak the frog doth place himself<br/>
			With muzzle out of water,—when is dreaming<br/>
			Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,—<br/></p>
			<p id="id01554">Livid, as far down as where shame appears,<br/>
			Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,<br/>
			Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01555">Each one his countenance held downward bent;<br/>
			From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart<br/>
			Among them witness of itself procures.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01556">When round about me somewhat I had looked,<br/>
			I downward turned me, and saw two so close,<br/>
			The hair upon their heads together mingled.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01557">"Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,"<br/>
			I said, "who are you;" and they bent their necks,<br/>
			And when to me their faces they had lifted,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01558">Their eyes, which first were only moist within,<br/>
			Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed<br/>
			The tears between, and locked them up again.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01559">Clamp never bound together wood with wood<br/>
			So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,<br/>
			Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01560">And one, who had by reason of the cold<br/>
			Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,<br/>
			Said: "Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?<br/></p>
			<p id="id01561">If thou desire to know who these two are,<br/>
			The valley whence Bisenzio descends<br/>
			Belonged to them and to their father Albert.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01562">They from one body came, and all Caina<br/>
			Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade<br/>
			More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01563">Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow<br/>
			At one and the same blow by Arthur's hand;<br/>
			Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers<br/></p>
			<p id="id01564">So with his head I see no farther forward,<br/>
			And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;<br/>
			Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01565">And that thou put me not to further speech,<br/>
			Know that I Camicion de' Pazzi was,<br/>
			And wait Carlino to exonerate me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01566">Then I beheld a thousand faces, made<br/>
			Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder,<br/>
			And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01567">And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle,<br/>
			Where everything of weight unites together,<br/>
			And I was shivering in the eternal shade,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01568">Whether 'twere will, or destiny, or chance,<br/>
			I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads<br/>
			I struck my foot hard in the face of one.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01569">Weeping he growled: "Why dost thou trample me?<br/>
			Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance<br/>
			of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01570">And I: "My Master, now wait here for me,<br/>
			That I through him may issue from a doubt;<br/>
			Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01571">The Leader stopped; and to that one I said<br/>
			Who was blaspheming vehemently still:<br/>
			"Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01572">"Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora<br/>
			Smiting," replied he, "other people's cheeks,<br/>
			So that, if thou wert living, 'twere too much?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01573">"Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,"<br/>
			Was my response, "if thou demandest fame,<br/>
			That 'mid the other notes thy name I place."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01574">And he to me: "For the reverse I long;<br/>
			Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;<br/>
			For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01575">Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,<br/>
			And said: "It must needs be thou name thyself,<br/>
			Or not a hair remain upon thee here."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01576">Whence he to me: "Though thou strip off my hair,<br/>
			I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,<br/>
			If on my head a thousand times thou fall."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01577">I had his hair in hand already twisted,<br/>
			And more than one shock of it had pulled out,<br/>
			He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01578">When cried another: "What doth ail thee, Bocca?<br/>
			Is't not enough to clatter with thy jaws,<br/>
			But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01579">"Now," said I, "I care not to have thee speak,<br/>
			Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame<br/>
			I will report of thee veracious news."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01580">"Begone," replied he, "and tell what thou wilt,<br/>
			But be not silent, if thou issue hence,<br/>
			Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01581">He weepeth here the silver of the French;<br/>
			'I saw,' thus canst thou phrase it, 'him of Duera<br/>
			There where the sinners stand out in the cold.'<br/></p>
			<p id="id01582">If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,<br/>

			<p id="id01584">Already we had gone away from him,<br/>

			<p id="id01587">"O thou, who showest by such bestial sign<br/>
			Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,<br/>

			<p id="id01588">That if thou rightfully of him complain,<br/>

			Already, when I dreamed the evil dream<br/>
			Which of the future rent for me the veil.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01600">This one appeared to me as lord and master,<br/>
			Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain<br/>
			For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01601">With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,<br/>
			Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi<br/>
			He had sent out before him to the front.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01602">After brief course seemed unto me forespent<br/>
			The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes<br/>
			It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01603">When I before the morrow was awake,<br/>
			Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons<br/>
			Who with me were, and asking after bread.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01604">Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,<br/>
			Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,<br/>
			And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?<br/></p>
			<p id="id01605">They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh<br/>
			At which our food used to be brought to us,<br/>
			And through his dream was each one apprehensive;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01606">And I heard locking up the under door<br/>
			Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word<br/>
			I gazed into the faces of my sons.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01607">I wept not, I within so turned to stone;<br/>
			They wept; and darling little Anselm mine<br/>
			Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?'<br/></p>
			<p id="id01608">Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made<br/>

			<p id="id01609">As now a little glimmer made its way<br/>
			Into the dolorous prison, and I saw<br/>
			Upon four faces my own very aspect,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01610">Both of my hands in agony I bit;<br/>
			And, thinking that I did it from desire<br/>
			Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01611">And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us<br/>
			If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us<br/>
			With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.'<br/></p>
			<p id="id01612">I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.<br/>
			That day we all were silent, and the next.<br/>
			Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?<br/></p>
			<p id="id01613">When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo<br/>

			And three days called them after they were dead;<br/>
			Then hunger did what sorrow could not do."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01616">When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,<br/>
			The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,<br/>
			Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01617">Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people<br/>
			Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound,<br/>
			Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01618">Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,<br/>
			And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno<br/>
			That every person in thee it may drown!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01619">For if Count Ugolino had the fame<br/>
			Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,<br/>
			Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01620">Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!<br/>
			Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,<br/>
			And the other two my song doth name above!<br/></p>
			<p id="id01621">We passed still farther onward, where the ice<br/>
			Another people ruggedly enswathes,<br/>
			Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01622">Weeping itself there does not let them weep,<br/>
			And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes<br/>
			Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01623">Because the earliest tears a cluster form,<br/>
			And, in the manner of a crystal visor,<br/>
			Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01624">And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,<br/>
			Because of cold all sensibility<br/>
			Its station had abandoned in my face,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01625">Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;<br/>
			Whence I: "My Master, who sets this in motion?<br/>
			Is not below here every vapour quenched?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01626">Whence he to me: "Full soon shalt thou be where<br/>
			Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,<br/>
			Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01627">And one of the wretches of the frozen crust<br/>
			Cried out to us: "O souls so merciless<br/>
			That the last post is given unto you,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01628">Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I<br/>
			May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart<br/>
			A little, e'er the weeping recongeal."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01629">Whence I to him: "If thou wouldst have me help thee<br/>
			Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,<br/>
			May I go to the bottom of the ice."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01630">Then he replied: "I am Friar Alberigo;<br/>
			He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,<br/>
			Who here a date am getting for my fig."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01631">"O," said I to him, "now art thou, too, dead?"<br/>
			And he to me: "How may my body fare<br/>
			Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01632">Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,<br/>
			That oftentimes the soul descendeth here<br/>
			Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01633">And, that thou mayest more willingly remove<br/>
			From off my countenance these glassy tears,<br/>
			Know that as soon as any soul betrays<br/></p>
			<p id="id01634">As I have done, his body by a demon<br/>
			Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,<br/>
			Until his time has wholly been revolved.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01635">Itself down rushes into such a cistern;<br/>
			And still perchance above appears the body<br/>
			Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01636">This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;<br/>
			It is Ser Branca d' Oria, and many years<br/>
			Have passed away since he was thus locked up."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01637">"I think," said I to him, "thou dost deceive me;<br/>
			For Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet,<br/>
			And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01638">"In moat above," said he, "of Malebranche,<br/>
			There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,<br/>
			As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01639">When this one left a devil in his stead<br/>
			In his own body and one near of kin,<br/>
			Who made together with him the betrayal.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01640">But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,<br/>
			Open mine eyes;"—and open them I did not,<br/>
			And to be rude to him was courtesy.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01641">Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance<br/>
			With every virtue, full of every vice<br/>
			Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?<br/></p>
			<p id="id01642">For with the vilest spirit of Romagna<br/>
			I found of you one such, who for his deeds<br/>
			In soul already in Cocytus bathes,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01643">And still above in body seems alive!</p>
			<p id="id01644" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXXIV</p>
			<p id="id01645" style="margin-top: 2em">"'Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni'<br/>
			Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,"<br/>
			My Master said, "if thou discernest him."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01646">As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when<br/>
			Our hemisphere is darkening into night,<br/>
			Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01647">Methought that such a building then I saw;<br/>
			And, for the wind, I drew myself behind<br/>
			My Guide, because there was no other shelter.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01648">Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,<br/>
			There where the shades were wholly covered up,<br/>
			And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01649">Some prone are lying, others stand erect,<br/>
			This with the head, and that one with the soles;<br/>
			Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01650">When in advance so far we had proceeded,<br/>
			That it my Master pleased to show to me<br/>
			The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01651">He from before me moved and made me stop,<br/>
			Saying: "Behold Dis, and behold the place<br/>
			Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01652">How frozen I became and powerless then,<br/>
			Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,<br/>
			Because all language would be insufficient.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01653">I did not die, and I alive remained not;<br/>
			Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,<br/>
			What I became, being of both deprived.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01654">The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous<br/>
			From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;<br/>
			And better with a giant I compare<br/></p>
			<p id="id01655">Than do the giants with those arms of his;<br/>
			Consider now how great must be that whole,<br/>
			Which unto such a part conforms itself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01656">Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,<br/>
			And lifted up his brow against his Maker,<br/>
			Well may proceed from him all tribulation.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01657">O, what a marvel it appeared to me,<br/>
			When I beheld three faces on his head!<br/>
			The one in front, and that vermilion was;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01658">Two were the others, that were joined with this<br/>
			Above the middle part of either shoulder,<br/>
			And they were joined together at the crest;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01659">And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;<br/>
			The left was such to look upon as those<br/>
			Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01660">Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,<br/>
			Such as befitting were so great a bird;<br/>
			Sails of the sea I never saw so large.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01661">No feathers had they, but as of a bat<br/>
			Their fashion was; and he was waving them,<br/>
			So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01662">Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.<br/>
			With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins<br/>
			Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01663">At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching<br/>
			A sinner, in the manner of a brake,<br/>
			So that he three of them tormented thus.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01664">To him in front the biting was as naught<br/>
			Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine<br/>
			Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01665">"That soul up there which has the greatest pain,"<br/>
			The Master said, "is Judas Iscariot;<br/>
			With head inside, he plies his legs without.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01666">Of the two others, who head downward are,<br/>
			The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;<br/>
			See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01667">And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.<br/>
			But night is reascending, and 'tis time<br/>
			That we depart, for we have seen the whole."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01668">As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,<br/>
			And he the vantage seized of time and place,<br/>
			And when the wings were opened wide apart,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01669">He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;<br/>
			From fell to fell descended downward then<br/>
			Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01670">When we were come to where the thigh revolves<br/>
			Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,<br/>
			The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01671">Turned round his head where he had had his legs,<br/>
			And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,<br/>
			So that to Hell I thought we were returning.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01672">"Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,"<br/>
			The Master said, panting as one fatigued,<br/>
			"Must we perforce depart from so much evil."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01673">Then through the opening of a rock he issued,<br/>
			And down upon the margin seated me;<br/>
			Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01674">I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see<br/>
			Lucifer in the same way I had left him;<br/>
			And I beheld him upward hold his legs.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01675">And if I then became disquieted,<br/>
			Let stolid people think who do not see<br/>
			What the point is beyond which I had passed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01676">"Rise up," the Master said, "upon thy feet;<br/>
			The way is long, and difficult the road,<br/>
			And now the sun to middle-tierce returns."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01677">It was not any palace corridor<br/>
			There where we were, but dungeon natural,<br/>
			With floor uneven and unease of light.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01678">"Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,<br/>
			My Master," said I when I had arisen,<br/>
			"To draw me from an error speak a little;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01679">Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed<br/>
			Thus upside down? and how in such short time<br/>
			From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id01680">And he to me: "Thou still imaginest<br/>
			Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped<br/>
			The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01681">That side thou wast, so long as I descended;<br/>
			When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point<br/>
			To which things heavy draw from every side,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01682">And now beneath the hemisphere art come<br/>
			Opposite that which overhangs the vast<br/>
			Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death<br/></p>
			<p id="id01683">The Man who without sin was born and lived.<br/>
			Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere<br/>
			Which makes the other face of the Judecca.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01684">Here it is morn when it is evening there;<br/>
			And he who with his hair a stairway made us<br/>
			Still fixed remaineth as he was before.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01685">Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;<br/>
			And all the land, that whilom here emerged,<br/>
			For fear of him made of the sea a veil,<br/></p>
			<p id="id01686">And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure<br/>
			To flee from him, what on this side appears<br/>
			Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled."<br/></p>
			<p id="id01687">A place there is below, from Beelzebub<br/>
			As far receding as the tomb extends,<br/>
			Which not by sight is known, but by the sound<br/></p>
			<p id="id01688">Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth<br/>
			Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed<br/>
			With course that winds about and slightly falls.<br/></p>
			<p id="id01689">The Guide and I into that hidden road<br/>
			Now entered, to return to the bright world;<br/>
			And without care of having any rest<br/></p>
			<p id="id01690">We mounted up, he first and I the second,<br/>
			Till I beheld through a round aperture<br/>
			Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;<br/></p>
			<p id="id01691">Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.</p>
