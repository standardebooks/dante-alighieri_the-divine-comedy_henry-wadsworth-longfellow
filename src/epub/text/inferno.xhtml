			<h2>Inferno</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto I</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Midway upon the journey of our life<br/>
			I found myself within a forest dark,<br/>
			For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</p>
			<p>Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say<br/>
			What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,<br/>
			Which in the very thought renews the fear.</p>
			<p>So bitter is it, death is little more;<br/>
			But of the good to treat, which there I found,<br/>
			Speak will I of the other things I saw there.</p>
			<p>I cannot well repeat how there I entered,<br/>
			So full was I of slumber at the moment<br/>
			In which I had abandoned the true way.</p>
			<p>But after I had reached a mountain's foot,<br/>
			At that point where the valley terminated,<br/>
			Which had with consternation pierced my heart,</p>
			<p>Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,<br/>
			Vested already with that planet's rays<br/>
			Which leadeth others right by every road.</p>
			<p>Then was the fear a little quieted<br/>
			That in my heart's lake had endured throughout<br/>
			The night, which I had passed so piteously.</p>
			<p>And even as he, who, with distressful breath,<br/>
			Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,<br/>
			Turns to the water perilous and gazes;</p>
			<p>So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,<br/>
			Turn itself back to re-behold the pass<br/>
			Which never yet a living person left.</p>
			<p>After my weary body I had rested,<br/>
			The way resumed I on the desert slope,<br/>
			So that the firm foot ever was the lower.</p>
			<p>And lo! almost where the ascent began,<br/>
			A panther light and swift exceedingly,<br/>
			Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!</p>
			<p>And never moved she from before my face,<br/>
			Nay, rather did impede so much my way,<br/>
			That many times I to return had turned.</p>
			<p>The time was the beginning of the morning,<br/>
			And up the sun was mounting with those stars<br/>
			That with him were, what time the Love Divine</p>
			<p>At first in motion set those beauteous things;<br/>
			So were to me occasion of good hope,<br/>
			The variegated skin of that wild beast,</p>
			<p>The hour of time, and the delicious season;<br/>
			But not so much, that did not give me fear<br/>
			A lion's aspect which appeared to me.</p>
			<p>He seemed as if against me he were coming<br/>
			With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,<br/>
			So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;</p>
			<p>And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings<br/>
			Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,<br/>
			And many folk has caused to live forlorn!</p>
			<p>She brought upon me so much heaviness,<br/>
			With the affright that from her aspect came,<br/>
			That I the hope relinquished of the height.</p>
			<p>And as he is who willingly acquires,<br/>
			And the time comes that causes him to lose,<br/>
			Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,</p>
			<p>E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,<br/>
			Which, coming on against me by degrees<br/>
			Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.</p>
			<p>While I was rushing downward to the lowland,<br/>
			Before mine eyes did one present himself,<br/>
			Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.</p>
			<p>When I beheld him in the desert vast,<br/>
			"Have pity on me," unto him I cried,<br/>
			"Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!"</p>
			<p>He answered me: "Not man; man once I was,<br/>
			And both my parents were of Lombardy,<br/>
			And Mantuans by country both of them.</p>
			<p>'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,<br/>
			And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,<br/>
			During the time of false and lying gods.</p>
			<p>A poet was I, and I sang that just<br/>
			Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,<br/>
			After that Ilion the superb was burned.</p>
			<p>But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?<br/>
			Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,<br/>
			Which is the source and cause of every joy?"</p>
			<p>"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain<br/>
			Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?"<br/>
			I made response to him with bashful forehead.</p>
			<p>"O, of the other poets honour and light,<br/>
			Avail me the long study and great love<br/>
			That have impelled me to explore thy volume!</p>
			<p>Thou art my master, and my author thou,<br/>
			Thou art alone the one from whom I took<br/>
			The beautiful style that has done honour to me.</p>
			<p>Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;<br/>
			Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,<br/>
			For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble."</p>
			<p>"Thee it behoves to take another road,"<br/>
			Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,<br/>
			"If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;</p>
			<p>Because this beast, at which thou criest out,<br/>
			Suffers not any one to pass her way,<br/>
			But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;</p>
			<p>And has a nature so malign and ruthless,<br/>
			That never doth she glut her greedy will,<br/>
			And after food is hungrier than before.</p>
			<p>Many the animals with whom she weds,<br/>
			And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound<br/>
			Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.</p>
			<p>He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,<br/>
			But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;<br/>
			'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;</p>
			<p>Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,<br/>
			On whose account the maid Camilla died,<br/>
			Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;</p>
			<p>Through every city shall he hunt her down,<br/>
			Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,<br/>
			There from whence envy first did let her loose.</p>
			<p>Therefore I think and judge it for thy best<br/>
			Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,<br/>
			And lead thee hence through the eternal place,</p>
			<p>Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,<br/>
			Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,<br/>
			Who cry out each one for the second death;</p>
			<p>And thou shalt see those who contented are<br/>
			Within the fire, because they hope to come,<br/>
			Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;</p>
			<p>To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,<br/>
			A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;<br/>
			With her at my departure I will leave thee;</p>
			<p>Because that Emperor, who reigns above,<br/>
			In that I was rebellious to his law,<br/>
			Wills that through me none come into his city.</p>
			<p>He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;<br/>
			There is his city and his lofty throne;<br/>
			O happy he whom thereto he elects!"</p>
			<p>And I to him: "Poet, I thee entreat,<br/>
			By that same God whom thou didst never know,<br/>
			So that I may escape this woe and worse,</p>
			<p>Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,<br/>
			That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,<br/>
			And those thou makest so disconsolate."</p>
			<p>Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto II</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Day was departing, and the embrowned air<br/>
			Released the animals that are on earth<br/>
			From their fatigues; and I the only one</p>
			<p>Made myself ready to sustain the war,<br/>
			Both of the way and likewise of the woe,<br/>
			Which memory that errs not shall retrace.</p>
			<p>O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!<br/>
			O memory, that didst write down what I saw,<br/>
			Here thy nobility shall be manifest!</p>
			<p>And I began: "Poet, who guidest me,<br/>
			Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,<br/>
			Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.</p>
			<p>Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,<br/>
			While yet corruptible, unto the world<br/>
			Immortal went, and was there bodily.</p>
			<p>But if the adversary of all evil<br/>
			Was courteous, thinking of the high effect<br/>
			That issue would from him, and who, and what,</p>
			<p>To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;<br/>
			For he was of great Rome, and of her empire<br/>
			In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;</p>
			<p>The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,<br/>
			Were stablished as the holy place, wherein<br/>
			Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.</p>
			<p>Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,<br/>
			Things did he hear, which the occasion were<br/>
			Both of his victory and the papal mantle.</p>
			<p>Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,<br/>
			To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,<br/>
			Which of salvation's way is the beginning.</p>
			<p>But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?<br/>
			I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,<br/>
			Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.</p>
			<p>Therefore, if I resign myself to come,<br/>
			I fear the coming may be ill-advised;<br/>
			Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak."</p>
			<p>And as he is, who unwills what he willed,<br/>
			And by new thoughts doth his intention change,<br/>
			So that from his design he quite withdraws,</p>
			<p>Such I became, upon that dark hillside,<br/>
			Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,<br/>
			Which was so very prompt in the beginning.</p>
			<p>"If I have well thy language understood,"<br/>
			Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,<br/>
			"Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,</p>
			<p>Which many times a man encumbers so,<br/>
			It turns him back from honoured enterprise,<br/>
			As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.</p>
			<p>That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,<br/>
			I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard<br/>
			At the first moment when I grieved for thee.</p>
			<p>Among those was I who are in suspense,<br/>
			And a fair, saintly Lady called to me<br/>
			In such wise, I besought her to command me.</p>
			<p>Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;<br/>
			And she began to say, gentle and low,<br/>
			With voice angelical, in her own language:</p>
			<p>'O spirit courteous of Mantua,<br/>
			Of whom the fame still in the world endures,<br/>
			And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;</p>
			<p>A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,<br/>
			Upon the desert slope is so impeded<br/>
			Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,</p>
			<p>And may, I fear, already be so lost,<br/>
			That I too late have risen to his succour,<br/>
			From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.</p>
			<p>Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,<br/>
			And with what needful is for his release,<br/>
			Assist him so, that I may be consoled.</p>
			<p>Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;<br/>
			I come from there, where I would fain return;<br/>
			Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.</p>
			<p>When I shall be in presence of my Lord,<br/>
			Full often will I praise thee unto him.'<br/>
			Then paused she, and thereafter I began:</p>
			<p>'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom<br/>
			The human race exceedeth all contained<br/>
			Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,</p>
			<p>So grateful unto me is thy commandment,<br/>
			To obey, if 'twere already done, were late;<br/>
			No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish.</p>
			<p>But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun<br/>
			The here descending down into this centre,<br/>
			From the vast place thou burnest to return to.'</p>
			<p>'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,<br/>
			Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,<br/>
			'Why I am not afraid to enter here.</p>
			<p>Of those things only should one be afraid<br/>
			Which have the power of doing others harm;<br/>
			Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.</p>
			<p>God in his mercy such created me<br/>
			That misery of yours attains me not,<br/>
			Nor any flame assails me of this burning.</p>
			<p>A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves<br/>
			At this impediment, to which I send thee,<br/>
			So that stern judgment there above is broken.</p>
			<p>In her entreaty she besought Lucia,<br/>
			And said, "Thy faithful one now stands in need<br/>
			Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him."</p>
			<p>Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,<br/>
			Hastened away, and came unto the place<br/>
			Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.</p>
			<p>"Beatrice" said she, "the true praise of God,<br/>
			Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,<br/>
			For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?</p>
			<p>Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?<br/>
			Dost thou not see the death that combats him<br/>
			Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?"</p>
			<p>Never were persons in the world so swift<br/>
			To work their weal and to escape their woe,<br/>
			As I, after such words as these were uttered,</p>
			<p>Came hither downward from my blessed seat,<br/>
			Confiding in thy dignified discourse,<br/>
			Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'</p>
			<p>After she thus had spoken unto me,<br/>
			Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;<br/>
			Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;</p>
			<p>And unto thee I came, as she desired;<br/>
			I have delivered thee from that wild beast,<br/>
			Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.</p>
			<p>What is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?<br/>
			Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?<br/>
			Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,</p>
			<p>Seeing that three such Ladies benedight<br/>
			Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,<br/>
			And so much good my speech doth promise thee?"</p>
			<p>Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,<br/>
			Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,<br/>
			Uplift themselves all open on their stems;</p>
			<p>Such I became with my exhausted strength,<br/>
			And such good courage to my heart there coursed,<br/>
			That I began, like an intrepid person:</p>
			<p>"O she compassionate, who succoured me,<br/>
			And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon<br/>
			The words of truth which she addressed to thee!</p>
			<p>Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed<br/>
			To the adventure, with these words of thine,<br/>
			That to my first intent I have returned.</p>
			<p>Now go, for one sole will is in us both,<br/>
			Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou."<br/>
			Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,</p>
			<p>I entered on the deep and savage way.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto III</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">"Through me the way is to the city dolent;<br/>
			Through me the way is to eternal dole;<br/>
			Through me the way among the people lost.</p>
			<p>Justice incited my sublime Creator;<br/>
			Created me divine Omnipotence,<br/>
			The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.</p>
			<p>Before me there were no created things,<br/>
			Only eterne, and I eternal last.<br/>
			All hope abandon, ye who enter in!"</p>
			<p>These words in sombre colour I beheld<br/>
			Written upon the summit of a gate;<br/>
			Whence I: "Their sense is, Master, hard to me!"</p>
			<p>And he to me, as one experienced:<br/>
			"Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,<br/>
			All cowardice must needs be here extinct.</p>
			<p>We to the place have come, where I have told thee<br/>
			Thou shalt behold the people dolorous<br/>
			Who have foregone the good of intellect."</p>
			<p>And after he had laid his hand on mine<br/>
			With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,<br/>
			He led me in among the secret things.</p>
			<p>There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud<br/>
			Resounded through the air without a star,<br/>
			Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.</p>
			<p>Languages diverse, horrible dialects,<br/>
			Accents of anger, words of agony,<br/>
			And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,</p>
			<p>Made up a tumult that goes whirling on<br/>
			For ever in that air for ever black,<br/>
			Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.</p>
			<p>And I, who had my head with horror bound,<br/>
			Said: "Master, what is this which now I hear?<br/>
			What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "This miserable mode<br/>
			Maintain the melancholy souls of those<br/>
			Who lived withouten infamy or praise.</p>
			<p>Commingled are they with that caitiff choir<br/>
			Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,<br/>
			Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.</p>
			<p>The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;<br/>
			Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,<br/>
			For glory none the damned would have from them."</p>
			<p>And I: "O Master, what so grievous is<br/>
			To these, that maketh them lament so sore?"<br/>
			He answered: "I will tell thee very briefly.</p>
			<p>These have no longer any hope of death;<br/>
			And this blind life of theirs is so debased,<br/>
			They envious are of every other fate.</p>
			<p>No fame of them the world permits to be;<br/>
			Misericord and Justice both disdain them.<br/>
			Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass."</p>
			<p>And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,<br/>
			Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,<br/>
			That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;</p>
			<p>And after it there came so long a train<br/>
			Of people, that I ne'er would have believed<br/>
			That ever Death so many had undone.</p>
			<p>When some among them I had recognised,<br/>
			I looked, and I beheld the shade of him<br/>
			Who made through cowardice the great refusal.</p>
			<p>Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,<br/>
			That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches<br/>
			Hateful to God and to his enemies.</p>
			<p>These miscreants, who never were alive,<br/>
			Were naked, and were stung exceedingly<br/>
			By gadflies and by hornets that were there.</p>
			<p>These did their faces irrigate with blood,<br/>
			Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet<br/>
			By the disgusting worms was gathered up.</p>
			<p>And when to gazing farther I betook me.<br/>
			People I saw on a great river's bank;<br/>
			Whence said I: "Master, now vouchsafe to me,</p>
			<p>That I may know who these are, and what law<br/>
			Makes them appear so ready to pass over,<br/>
			As I discern athwart the dusky light."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "These things shall all be known<br/>
			To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay<br/>
			Upon the dismal shore of Acheron."</p>
			<p>Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,<br/>
			Fearing my words might irksome be to him,<br/>
			From speech refrained I till we reached the river.</p>
			<p>And lo! towards us coming in a boat<br/>
			An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,<br/>
			Crying: "Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!</p>
			<p>Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;<br/>
			I come to lead you to the other shore,<br/>
			To the eternal shades in heat and frost.</p>
			<p>And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,<br/>
			Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!"<br/>
			But when he saw that I did not withdraw,</p>
			<p>He said: "By other ways, by other ports<br/>
			Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;<br/>
			A lighter vessel needs must carry thee."</p>
			<p>And unto him the Guide: "Vex thee not, Charon;<br/>
			It is so willed there where is power to do<br/>
			That which is willed; and farther question not."</p>
			<p>Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks<br/>
			Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,<br/>
			Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.</p>
			<p>But all those souls who weary were and naked<br/>
			Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,<br/>
			As soon as they had heard those cruel words.</p>
			<p>God they blasphemed and their progenitors,<br/>
			The human race, the place, the time, the seed<br/>
			Of their engendering and of their birth!</p>
			<p>Thereafter all together they drew back,<br/>
			Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,<br/>
			Which waiteth every man who fears not God.</p>
			<p>Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,<br/>
			Beckoning to them, collects them all together,<br/>
			Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.</p>
			<p>As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,<br/>
			First one and then another, till the branch<br/>
			Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;</p>
			<p>In similar wise the evil seed of Adam<br/>
			Throw themselves from that margin one by one,<br/>
			At signals, as a bird unto its lure.</p>
			<p>So they depart across the dusky wave,<br/>
			And ere upon the other side they land,<br/>
			Again on this side a new troop assembles.</p>
			<p>"My son," the courteous Master said to me,<br/>
			"All those who perish in the wrath of God<br/>
			Here meet together out of every land;</p>
			<p>And ready are they to pass o'er the river,<br/>
			Because celestial Justice spurs them on,<br/>
			So that their fear is turned into desire.</p>
			<p>This way there never passes a good soul;<br/>
			And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,<br/>
			Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports."</p>
			<p>This being finished, all the dusk champaign<br/>
			Trembled so violently, that of that terror<br/>
			The recollection bathes me still with sweat.</p>
			<p>The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,<br/>
			And fulminated a vermilion light,<br/>
			Which overmastered in me every sense,</p>
			<p>And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto IV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Broke the deep lethargy within my head<br/>
			A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,<br/>
			Like to a person who by force is wakened;</p>
			<p>And round about I moved my rested eyes,<br/>
			Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,<br/>
			To recognise the place wherein I was.</p>
			<p>True is it, that upon the verge I found me<br/>
			Of the abysmal valley dolorous,<br/>
			That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.</p>
			<p>Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,<br/>
			So that by fixing on its depths my sight<br/>
			Nothing whatever I discerned therein.</p>
			<p>"Let us descend now into the blind world,"<br/>
			Began the Poet, pallid utterly;<br/>
			"I will be first, and thou shalt second be."</p>
			<p>And I, who of his colour was aware,<br/>
			Said: "How shall I come, if thou art afraid,<br/>
			Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "The anguish of the people<br/>
			Who are below here in my face depicts<br/>
			That pity which for terror thou hast taken.</p>
			<p>Let us go on, for the long way impels us."<br/>
			Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter<br/>
			The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.</p>
			<p>There, as it seemed to me from listening,<br/>
			Were lamentations none, but only sighs,<br/>
			That tremble made the everlasting air.</p>
			<p>And this arose from sorrow without torment,<br/>
			Which the crowds had, that many were and great,<br/>
			Of infants and of women and of men.</p>
			<p>To me the Master good: "Thou dost not ask<br/>
			What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?<br/>
			Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,</p>
			<p>That they sinned not; and if they merit had,<br/>
			'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism<br/>
			Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;</p>
			<p>And if they were before Christianity,<br/>
			In the right manner they adored not God;<br/>
			And among such as these am I myself.</p>
			<p>For such defects, and not for other guilt,<br/>
			Lost are we and are only so far punished,<br/>
			That without hope we live on in desire."</p>
			<p>Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,<br/>
			Because some people of much worthiness<br/>
			I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.</p>
			<p>"Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,"<br/>
			Began I, with desire of being certain<br/>
			Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,</p>
			<p>"Came any one by his own merit hence,<br/>
			Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?"<br/>
			And he, who understood my covert speech,</p>
			<p>Replied: "I was a novice in this state,<br/>
			When I saw hither come a Mighty One,<br/>
			With sign of victory incoronate.</p>
			<p>Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,<br/>
			And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,<br/>
			Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient</p>
			<p>Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,<br/>
			Israel with his father and his children,<br/>
			And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,</p>
			<p>And others many, and he made them blessed;<br/>
			And thou must know, that earlier than these<br/>
			Never were any human spirits saved."</p>
			<p>We ceased not to advance because he spake,<br/>
			But still were passing onward through the forest,<br/>
			The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.</p>
			<p>Not very far as yet our way had gone<br/>
			This side the summit, when I saw a fire<br/>
			That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.</p>
			<p>We were a little distant from it still,<br/>
			But not so far that I in part discerned not<br/>
			That honourable people held that place.</p>
			<p>"O thou who honourest every art and science,<br/>
			Who may these be, which such great honour have,<br/>
			That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "The honourable name,<br/>
			That sounds of them above there in thy life,<br/>
			Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them."</p>
			<p>In the mean time a voice was heard by me:<br/>
			"All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;<br/>
			His shade returns again, that was departed."</p>
			<p>After the voice had ceased and quiet was,<br/>
			Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;<br/>
			Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.</p>
			<p>To say to me began my gracious Master:<br/>
			"Him with that falchion in his hand behold,<br/>
			Who comes before the three, even as their lord.</p>
			<p>That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;<br/>
			He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;<br/>
			The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.</p>
			<p>Because to each of these with me applies<br/>
			The name that solitary voice proclaimed,<br/>
			They do me honour, and in that do well."</p>
			<p>Thus I beheld assemble the fair school<br/>
			Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,<br/>
			Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.</p>
			<p>When they together had discoursed somewhat,<br/>
			They turned to me with signs of salutation,<br/>
			And on beholding this, my Master smiled;</p>
			<p>And more of honour still, much more, they did me,<br/>
			In that they made me one of their own band;<br/>
			So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.</p>
			<p>Thus we went on as far as to the light,<br/>
			Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,<br/>
			As was the saying of them where I was.</p>
			<p>We came unto a noble castle's foot,<br/>
			Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,<br/>
			Defended round by a fair rivulet;</p>
			<p>This we passed over even as firm ground;<br/>
			Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;<br/>
			We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.</p>
			<p>People were there with solemn eyes and slow,<br/>
			Of great authority in their countenance;<br/>
			They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.</p>
			<p>Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side<br/>
			Into an opening luminous and lofty,<br/>
			So that they all of them were visible.</p>
			<p>There opposite, upon the green enamel,<br/>
			Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,<br/>
			Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.</p>
			<p>I saw Electra with companions many,<br/>
			'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,<br/>
			Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;</p>
			<p>I saw Camilla and Penthesilea<br/>
			On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,<br/>
			Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;</p>
			<p>I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,<br/>
			Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,<br/>
			And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.</p>
			<p>When I had lifted up my brows a little,<br/>
			The Master I beheld of those who know,<br/>
			Sit with his philosophic family.</p>
			<p>All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.<br/>
			There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,<br/>
			Who nearer him before the others stand;</p>
			<p>Democritus, who puts the world on chance,<br/>
			Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,<br/>
			Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;</p>
			<p>Of qualities I saw the good collector,<br/>
			Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,<br/>
			Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,</p>
			<p>Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,<br/>
			Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,<br/>
			Averroes, who the great Comment made.</p>
			<p>I cannot all of them pourtray in full,<br/>
			Because so drives me onward the long theme,<br/>
			That many times the word comes short of fact.</p>
			<p>The sixfold company in two divides;<br/>
			Another way my sapient Guide conducts me<br/>
			Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;</p>
			<p>And to a place I come where nothing shines.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto V</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Thus I descended out of the first circle<br/>
			Down to the second, that less space begirds,<br/>
			And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.</p>
			<p>There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;<br/>
			Examines the transgressions at the entrance;<br/>
			Judges, and sends according as he girds him.</p>
			<p>I say, that when the spirit evil-born<br/>
			Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;<br/>
			And this discriminator of transgressions</p>
			<p>Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;<br/>
			Girds himself with his tail as many times<br/>
			As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.</p>
			<p>Always before him many of them stand;<br/>
			They go by turns each one unto the judgment;<br/>
			They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.</p>
			<p>"O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry<br/>
			Comest," said Minos to me, when he saw me,<br/>
			Leaving the practice of so great an office,</p>
			<p>"Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;<br/>
			Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee."<br/>
			And unto him my Guide: "Why criest thou too?</p>
			<p>Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;<br/>
			It is so willed there where is power to do<br/>
			That which is willed; and ask no further question."</p>
			<p>And now begin the dolesome notes to grow<br/>
			Audible unto me; now am I come<br/>
			There where much lamentation strikes upon me.</p>
			<p>I came into a place mute of all light,<br/>
			Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,<br/>
			If by opposing winds 't is combated.</p>
			<p>The infernal hurricane that never rests<br/>
			Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;<br/>
			Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.</p>
			<p>When they arrive before the precipice,<br/>
			There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,<br/>
			There they blaspheme the puissance divine.</p>
			<p>I understood that unto such a torment<br/>
			The carnal malefactors were condemned,<br/>
			Who reason subjugate to appetite.</p>
			<p>And as the wings of starlings bear them on<br/>
			In the cold season in large band and full,<br/>
			So doth that blast the spirits maledict;</p>
			<p>It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;<br/>
			No hope doth comfort them for evermore,<br/>
			Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.</p>
			<p>And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,<br/>
			Making in air a long line of themselves,<br/>
			So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,</p>
			<p>Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.<br/>
			Whereupon said I: "Master, who are those<br/>
			People, whom the black air so castigates?"</p>
			<p>"The first of those, of whom intelligence<br/>
			Thou fain wouldst have," then said he unto me,<br/>
			"The empress was of many languages.</p>
			<p>To sensual vices she was so abandoned,<br/>
			That lustful she made licit in her law,<br/>
			To remove the blame to which she had been led.</p>
			<p>She is Semiramis, of whom we read<br/>
			That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;<br/>
			She held the land which now the Sultan rules.</p>
			<p>The next is she who killed herself for love,<br/>
			And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;<br/>
			Then Cleopatra the voluptuous."</p>
			<p>Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless<br/>
			Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,<br/>
			Who at the last hour combated with Love.</p>
			<p>Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand<br/>
			Shades did he name and point out with his finger,<br/>
			Whom Love had separated from our life.</p>
			<p>After that I had listened to my Teacher,<br/>
			Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,<br/>
			Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.</p>
			<p>And I began: "O Poet, willingly<br/>
			Speak would I to those two, who go together,<br/>
			And seem upon the wind to be so light."</p>
			<p>And, he to me: "Thou'lt mark, when they shall be<br/>
			Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them<br/>
			By love which leadeth them, and they will come."</p>
			<p>Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,<br/>
			My voice uplift I: "O ye weary souls!<br/>
			Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it."</p>
			<p>As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,<br/>
			With open and steady wings to the sweet nest<br/>
			Fly through the air by their volition borne,</p>
			<p>So came they from the band where Dido is,<br/>
			Approaching us athwart the air malign,<br/>
			So strong was the affectionate appeal.</p>
			<p>"O living creature gracious and benignant,<br/>
			Who visiting goest through the purple air<br/>
			Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,</p>
			<p>If were the King of the Universe our friend,<br/>
			We would pray unto him to give thee peace,<br/>
			Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.</p>
			<p>Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,<br/>
			That will we hear, and we will speak to you,<br/>
			While silent is the wind, as it is now.</p>
			<p>Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,<br/>
			Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends<br/>
			To rest in peace with all his retinue.</p>
			<p>Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,<br/>
			Seized this man for the person beautiful<br/>
			That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.</p>
			<p>Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,<br/>
			Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,<br/>
			That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;</p>
			<p>Love has conducted us unto one death;<br/>
			Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!"<br/>
			These words were borne along from them to us.</p>
			<p>As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,<br/>
			I bowed my face, and so long held it down<br/>
			Until the Poet said to me: "What thinkest?"</p>
			<p>When I made answer, I began: "Alas!<br/>
			How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,<br/>
			Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!"</p>
			<p>Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,<br/>
			And I began: "Thine agonies, Francesca,<br/>
			Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.</p>
			<p>But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,<br/>
			By what and in what manner Love conceded,<br/>
			That you should know your dubious desires?"</p>
			<p>And she to me: "There is no greater sorrow<br/>
			Than to be mindful of the happy time<br/>
			In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.</p>
			<p>But, if to recognise the earliest root<br/>
			Of love in us thou hast so great desire,<br/>
			I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.</p>
			<p>One day we reading were for our delight<br/>
			Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.<br/>
			Alone we were and without any fear.</p>
			<p>Full many a time our eyes together drew<br/>
			That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;<br/>
			But one point only was it that o'ercame us.</p>
			<p>When as we read of the much-longed-for smile<br/>
			Being by such a noble lover kissed,<br/>
			This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,</p>
			<p>Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.<br/>
			Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.<br/>
			That day no farther did we read therein."</p>
			<p>And all the while one spirit uttered this,<br/>
			The other one did weep so, that, for pity,<br/>
			I swooned away as if I had been dying,</p>
			<p>And fell, even as a dead body falls.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto VI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">At the return of consciousness, that closed<br/>
			Before the pity of those two relations,<br/>
			Which utterly with sadness had confused me,</p>
			<p>New torments I behold, and new tormented<br/>
			Around me, whichsoever way I move,<br/>
			And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.</p>
			<p>In the third circle am I of the rain<br/>
			Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;<br/>
			Its law and quality are never new.</p>
			<p>Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,<br/>
			Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;<br/>
			Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.</p>
			<p>Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,<br/>
			With his three gullets like a dog is barking<br/>
			Over the people that are there submerged.</p>
			<p>Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,<br/>
			And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;<br/>
			He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.</p>
			<p>Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;<br/>
			One side they make a shelter for the other;<br/>
			Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.</p>
			<p>When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!<br/>
			His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;<br/>
			Not a limb had he that was motionless.</p>
			<p>And my Conductor, with his spans extended,<br/>
			Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,<br/>
			He threw it into those rapacious gullets.</p>
			<p>Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,<br/>
			And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,<br/>
			For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,</p>
			<p>The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed<br/>
			Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders<br/>
			Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.</p>
			<p>We passed across the shadows, which subdues<br/>
			The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet<br/>
			Upon their vanity that person seems.</p>
			<p>They all were lying prone upon the earth,<br/>
			Excepting one, who sat upright as soon<br/>
			As he beheld us passing on before him.</p>
			<p>"O thou that art conducted through this Hell,"<br/>
			He said to me, "recall me, if thou canst;<br/>
			Thyself wast made before I was unmade."</p>
			<p>And I to him: "The anguish which thou hast<br/>
			Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,<br/>
			So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.</p>
			<p>But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful<br/>
			A place art put, and in such punishment,<br/>
			If some are greater, none is so displeasing."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Thy city, which is full<br/>
			Of envy so that now the sack runs over,<br/>
			Held me within it in the life serene.</p>
			<p>You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;<br/>
			For the pernicious sin of gluttony<br/>
			I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.</p>
			<p>And I, sad soul, am not the only one,<br/>
			For all these suffer the like penalty<br/>
			For the like sin;" and word no more spake he.</p>
			<p>I answered him: "Ciacco, thy wretchedness<br/>
			Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;<br/>
			But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come</p>
			<p>The citizens of the divided city;<br/>
			If any there be just; and the occasion<br/>
			Tell me why so much discord has assailed it."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "They, after long contention,<br/>
			Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party<br/>
			Will drive the other out with much offence.</p>
			<p>Then afterwards behoves it this one fall<br/>
			Within three suns, and rise again the other<br/>
			By force of him who now is on the coast.</p>
			<p>High will it hold its forehead a long while,<br/>
			Keeping the other under heavy burdens,<br/>
			Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.</p>
			<p>The just are two, and are not understood there;<br/>
			Envy and Arrogance and Avarice<br/>
			Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled."</p>
			<p>Here ended he his tearful utterance;<br/>
			And I to him: "I wish thee still to teach me,<br/>
			And make a gift to me of further speech.</p>
			<p>Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,<br/>
			Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,<br/>
			And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,</p>
			<p>Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;<br/>
			For great desire constraineth me to learn<br/>
			If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom."</p>
			<p>And he: "They are among the blacker souls;<br/>
			A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;<br/>
			If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.</p>
			<p>But when thou art again in the sweet world,<br/>
			I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;<br/>
			No more I tell thee and no more I answer."</p>
			<p>Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,<br/>
			Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;<br/>
			He fell therewith prone like the other blind.</p>
			<p>And the Guide said to me: "He wakes no more<br/>
			This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;<br/>
			When shall approach the hostile Potentate,</p>
			<p>Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,<br/>
			Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,<br/>
			Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes."</p>
			<p>So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture<br/>
			Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,<br/>
			Touching a little on the future life.</p>
			<p>Wherefore I said: "Master, these torments here,<br/>
			Will they increase after the mighty sentence,<br/>
			Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Return unto thy science,<br/>
			Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,<br/>
			The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.</p>
			<p>Albeit that this people maledict<br/>
			To true perfection never can attain,<br/>
			Hereafter more than now they look to be."</p>
			<p>Round in a circle by that road we went,<br/>
			Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;<br/>
			We came unto the point where the descent is;</p>
			<p>There we found Plutus the great enemy.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto VII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">"Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!"<br/>
			Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;<br/>
			And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,</p>
			<p>Said, to encourage me: "Let not thy fear<br/>
			Harm thee; for any power that he may have<br/>
			Shall not prevent thy going down this crag."</p>
			<p>Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,<br/>
			And said: "Be silent, thou accursed wolf;<br/>
			Consume within thyself with thine own rage.</p>
			<p>Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;<br/>
			Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought<br/>
			Vengeance upon the proud adultery."</p>
			<p>Even as the sails inflated by the wind<br/>
			Involved together fall when snaps the mast,<br/>
			So fell the cruel monster to the earth.</p>
			<p>Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,<br/>
			Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore<br/>
			Which all the woe of the universe insacks.</p>
			<p>Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many<br/>
			New toils and sufferings as I beheld?<br/>
			And why doth our transgression waste us so?</p>
			<p>As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,<br/>
			That breaks itself on that which it encounters,<br/>
			So here the folk must dance their roundelay.</p>
			<p>Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,<br/>
			On one side and the other, with great howls,<br/>
			Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.</p>
			<p>They clashed together, and then at that point<br/>
			Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,<br/>
			Crying, "Why keepest?" and, "Why squanderest thou?"</p>
			<p>Thus they returned along the lurid circle<br/>
			On either hand unto the opposite point,<br/>
			Shouting their shameful metre evermore.</p>
			<p>Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about<br/>
			Through his half-circle to another joust;<br/>
			And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,</p>
			<p>Exclaimed: "My Master, now declare to me<br/>
			What people these are, and if all were clerks,<br/>
			These shaven crowns upon the left of us."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "All of them were asquint<br/>
			In intellect in the first life, so much<br/>
			That there with measure they no spending made.</p>
			<p>Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,<br/>
			Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle,<br/>
			Where sunders them the opposite defect.</p>
			<p>Clerks those were who no hairy covering<br/>
			Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,<br/>
			In whom doth Avarice practise its excess."</p>
			<p>And I: "My Master, among such as these<br/>
			I ought forsooth to recognise some few,<br/>
			Who were infected with these maladies."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Vain thought thou entertainest;<br/>
			The undiscerning life which made them sordid<br/>
			Now makes them unto all discernment dim.</p>
			<p>Forever shall they come to these two buttings;<br/>
			These from the sepulchre shall rise again<br/>
			With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.</p>
			<p>Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world<br/>
			Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;<br/>
			Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it.</p>
			<p>Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce<br/>
			Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,<br/>
			For which the human race each other buffet;</p>
			<p>For all the gold that is beneath the moon,<br/>
			Or ever has been, of these weary souls<br/>
			Could never make a single one repose."</p>
			<p>"Master," I said to him, "now tell me also<br/>
			What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,<br/>
			That has the world's goods so within its clutches?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "O creatures imbecile,<br/>
			What ignorance is this which doth beset you?<br/>
			Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.</p>
			<p>He whose omniscience everything transcends<br/>
			The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,<br/>
			That every part to every part may shine,</p>
			<p>Distributing the light in equal measure;<br/>
			He in like manner to the mundane splendours<br/>
			Ordained a general ministress and guide,</p>
			<p>That she might change at times the empty treasures<br/>
			From race to race, from one blood to another,<br/>
			Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.</p>
			<p>Therefore one people triumphs, and another<br/>
			Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,<br/>
			Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.</p>
			<p>Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;<br/>
			She makes provision, judges, and pursues<br/>
			Her governance, as theirs the other gods.</p>
			<p>Her permutations have not any truce;<br/>
			Necessity makes her precipitate,<br/>
			So often cometh who his turn obtains.</p>
			<p>And this is she who is so crucified<br/>
			Even by those who ought to give her praise,<br/>
			Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.</p>
			<p>But she is blissful, and she hears it not;<br/>
			Among the other primal creatures gladsome<br/>
			She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.</p>
			<p>Let us descend now unto greater woe;<br/>
			Already sinks each star that was ascending<br/>
			When I set out, and loitering is forbidden."</p>
			<p>We crossed the circle to the other bank,<br/>
			Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself<br/>
			Along a gully that runs out of it.</p>
			<p>The water was more sombre far than perse;<br/>
			And we, in company with the dusky waves,<br/>
			Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.</p>
			<p>A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,<br/>
			This tristful brooklet, when it has descended<br/>
			Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.</p>
			<p>And I, who stood intent upon beholding,<br/>
			Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,<br/>
			All of them naked and with angry look.</p>
			<p>They smote each other not alone with hands,<br/>
			But with the head and with the breast and feet,<br/>
			Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.</p>
			<p>Said the good Master: "Son, thou now beholdest<br/>
			The souls of those whom anger overcame;<br/>
			And likewise I would have thee know for certain</p>
			<p>Beneath the water people are who sigh<br/>
			And make this water bubble at the surface,<br/>
			As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns.</p>
			<p>Fixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were<br/>
			In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,<br/>
			Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;</p>
			<p>Now we are sullen in this sable mire.'<br/>
			This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,<br/>
			For with unbroken words they cannot say it."</p>
			<p>Thus we went circling round the filthy fen<br/>
			A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,<br/>
			With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;</p>
			<p>Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto VIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">I say, continuing, that long before<br/>
			We to the foot of that high tower had come,<br/>
			Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,</p>
			<p>By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,<br/>
			And from afar another answer them,<br/>
			So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.</p>
			<p>And, to the sea of all discernment turned,<br/>
			I said: "What sayeth this, and what respondeth<br/>
			That other fire? and who are they that made it?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Across the turbid waves<br/>
			What is expected thou canst now discern,<br/>
			If reek of the morass conceal it not."</p>
			<p>Cord never shot an arrow from itself<br/>
			That sped away athwart the air so swift,<br/>
			As I beheld a very little boat</p>
			<p>Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,<br/>
			Under the guidance of a single pilot,<br/>
			Who shouted, "Now art thou arrived, fell soul?"</p>
			<p>"Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain<br/>
			For this once," said my Lord; "thou shalt not have us<br/>
			Longer than in the passing of the slough."</p>
			<p>As he who listens to some great deceit<br/>
			That has been done to him, and then resents it,<br/>
			Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.</p>
			<p>My Guide descended down into the boat,<br/>
			And then he made me enter after him,<br/>
			And only when I entered seemed it laden.</p>
			<p>Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,<br/>
			The antique prow goes on its way, dividing<br/>
			More of the water than 'tis wont with others.</p>
			<p>While we were running through the dead canal,<br/>
			Uprose in front of me one full of mire,<br/>
			And said, "Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?"</p>
			<p>And I to him: "Although I come, I stay not;<br/>
			But who art thou that hast become so squalid?"<br/>
			"Thou seest that I am one who weeps," he answered.</p>
			<p>And I to him: "With weeping and with wailing,<br/>
			Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;<br/>
			For thee I know, though thou art all defiled."</p>
			<p>Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;<br/>
			Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,<br/>
			Saying, "Away there with the other dogs!"</p>
			<p>Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;<br/>
			He kissed my face, and said: "Disdainful soul,<br/>
			Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.</p>
			<p>That was an arrogant person in the world;<br/>
			Goodness is none, that decks his memory;<br/>
			So likewise here his shade is furious.</p>
			<p>How many are esteemed great kings up there,<br/>
			Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,<br/>
			Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!"</p>
			<p>And I: "My Master, much should I be pleased,<br/>
			If I could see him soused into this broth,<br/>
			Before we issue forth out of the lake."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Ere unto thee the shore<br/>
			Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;<br/>
			Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy."</p>
			<p>A little after that, I saw such havoc<br/>
			Made of him by the people of the mire,<br/>
			That still I praise and thank my God for it.</p>
			<p>They all were shouting, "At Philippo Argenti!"<br/>
			And that exasperate spirit Florentine<br/>
			Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.</p>
			<p>We left him there, and more of him I tell not;<br/>
			But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,<br/>
			Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.</p>
			<p>And the good Master said: "Even now, my Son,<br/>
			The city draweth near whose name is Dis,<br/>
			With the grave citizens, with the great throng."</p>
			<p>And I: "Its mosques already, Master, clearly<br/>
			Within there in the valley I discern<br/>
			Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire</p>
			<p>They were."  And he to me: "The fire eternal<br/>
			That kindles them within makes them look red,<br/>
			As thou beholdest in this nether Hell."</p>
			<p>Then we arrived within the moats profound,<br/>
			That circumvallate that disconsolate city;<br/>
			The walls appeared to me to be of iron.</p>
			<p>Not without making first a circuit wide,<br/>
			We came unto a place where loud the pilot<br/>
			Cried out to us, "Debark, here is the entrance."</p>
			<p>More than a thousand at the gates I saw<br/>
			Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily<br/>
			Were saying, "Who is this that without death</p>
			<p>Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?"<br/>
			And my sagacious Master made a sign<br/>
			Of wishing secretly to speak with them.</p>
			<p>A little then they quelled their great disdain,<br/>
			And said: "Come thou alone, and he begone<br/>
			Who has so boldly entered these dominions.</p>
			<p>Let him return alone by his mad road;<br/>
			Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,<br/>
			Who hast escorted him through such dark regions."</p>
			<p>Think, Reader, if I was discomforted<br/>
			At utterance of the accursed words;<br/>
			For never to return here I believed.</p>
			<p>"O my dear Guide, who more than seven times<br/>
			Hast rendered me security, and drawn me<br/>
			From imminent peril that before me stood,</p>
			<p>Do not desert me," said I, "thus undone;<br/>
			And if the going farther be denied us,<br/>
			Let us retrace our steps together swiftly."</p>
			<p>And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,<br/>
			Said unto me: "Fear not; because our passage<br/>
			None can take from us, it by Such is given.</p>
			<p>But here await me, and thy weary spirit<br/>
			Comfort and nourish with a better hope;<br/>
			For in this nether world I will not leave thee."</p>
			<p>So onward goes and there abandons me<br/>
			My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,<br/>
			For No and Yes within my head contend.</p>
			<p>I could not hear what he proposed to them;<br/>
			But with them there he did not linger long,<br/>
			Ere each within in rivalry ran back.</p>
			<p>They closed the portals, those our adversaries,<br/>
			On my Lord's breast, who had remained without<br/>
			And turned to me with footsteps far between.</p>
			<p>His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he<br/>
			Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,<br/>
			"Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?"</p>
			<p>And unto me: "Thou, because I am angry,<br/>
			Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,<br/>
			Whatever for defence within be planned.</p>
			<p>This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;<br/>
			For once they used it at less secret gate,<br/>
			Which finds itself without a fastening still.</p>
			<p>O'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;<br/>
			And now this side of it descends the steep,<br/>
			Passing across the circles without escort,</p>
			<p>One by whose means the city shall be opened."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto IX</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">That hue which cowardice brought out on me,<br/>
			Beholding my Conductor backward turn,<br/>
			Sooner repressed within him his new colour.</p>
			<p>He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,<br/>
			Because the eye could not conduct him far<br/>
			Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.</p>
			<p>"Still it behoveth us to win the fight,"<br/>
			Began he; "Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .<br/>
			O how I long that some one here arrive!"</p>
			<p>Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning<br/>
			He covered up with what came afterward,<br/>
			That they were words quite different from the first;</p>
			<p>But none the less his saying gave me fear,<br/>
			Because I carried out the broken phrase,<br/>
			Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.</p>
			<p>"Into this bottom of the doleful conch<br/>
			Doth any e'er descend from the first grade,<br/>
			Which for its pain has only hope cut off?"</p>
			<p>This question put I; and he answered me:<br/>
			"Seldom it comes to pass that one of us<br/>
			Maketh the journey upon which I go.</p>
			<p>True is it, once before I here below<br/>
			Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,<br/>
			Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.</p>
			<p>Naked of me short while the flesh had been,<br/>
			Before within that wall she made me enter,<br/>
			To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;</p>
			<p>That is the lowest region and the darkest,<br/>
			And farthest from the heaven which circles all.<br/>
			Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.</p>
			<p>This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,<br/>
			Encompasses about the city dolent,<br/>
			Where now we cannot enter without anger."</p>
			<p>And more he said, but not in mind I have it;<br/>
			Because mine eye had altogether drawn me<br/>
			Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,</p>
			<p>Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen<br/>
			The three infernal Furies stained with blood,<br/>
			Who had the limbs of women and their mien,</p>
			<p>And with the greenest hydras were begirt;<br/>
			Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,<br/>
			Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.</p>
			<p>And he who well the handmaids of the Queen<br/>
			Of everlasting lamentation knew,<br/>
			Said unto me: "Behold the fierce Erinnys.</p>
			<p>This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;<br/>
			She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;<br/>
			Tisiphone is between;" and then was silent.</p>
			<p>Each one her breast was rending with her nails;<br/>
			They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,<br/>
			That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.</p>
			<p>"Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!"<br/>
			All shouted looking down; "in evil hour<br/>
			Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!"</p>
			<p>"Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,<br/>
			For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,<br/>
			No more returning upward would there be."</p>
			<p>Thus said the Master; and he turned me round<br/>
			Himself, and trusted not unto my hands<br/>
			So far as not to blind me with his own.</p>
			<p>O ye who have undistempered intellects,<br/>
			Observe the doctrine that conceals itself<br/>
			Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!</p>
			<p>And now there came across the turbid waves<br/>
			The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,<br/>
			Because of which both of the margins trembled;</p>
			<p>Not otherwise it was than of a wind<br/>
			Impetuous on account of adverse heats,<br/>
			That smites the forest, and, without restraint,</p>
			<p>The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;<br/>
			Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,<br/>
			And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.</p>
			<p>Mine eyes he loosed, and said: "Direct the nerve<br/>
			Of vision now along that ancient foam,<br/>
			There yonder where that smoke is most intense."</p>
			<p>Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent<br/>
			Across the water scatter all abroad,<br/>
			Until each one is huddled in the earth.</p>
			<p>More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,<br/>
			Thus fleeing from before one who on foot<br/>
			Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet.</p>
			<p>From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,<br/>
			Waving his left hand oft in front of him,<br/>
			And only with that anguish seemed he weary.</p>
			<p>Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,<br/>
			And to the Master turned; and he made sign<br/>
			That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.</p>
			<p>Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!<br/>
			He reached the gate, and with a little rod<br/>
			He opened it, for there was no resistance.</p>
			<p>"O banished out of Heaven, people despised!"<br/>
			Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;<br/>
			"Whence is this arrogance within you couched?</p>
			<p>Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,<br/>
			From which the end can never be cut off,<br/>
			And which has many times increased your pain?</p>
			<p>What helpeth it to butt against the fates?<br/>
			Your Cerberus, if you remember well,<br/>
			For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled."</p>
			<p>Then he returned along the miry road,<br/>
			And spake no word to us, but had the look<br/>
			Of one whom other care constrains and goads</p>
			<p>Than that of him who in his presence is;<br/>
			And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,<br/>
			After those holy words all confident.</p>
			<p>Within we entered without any contest;<br/>
			And I, who inclination had to see<br/>
			What the condition such a fortress holds,</p>
			<p>Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,<br/>
			And see on every hand an ample plain,<br/>
			Full of distress and torment terrible.</p>
			<p>Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,<br/>
			Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,<br/>
			That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,</p>
			<p>The sepulchres make all the place uneven;<br/>
			So likewise did they there on every side,<br/>
			Saving that there the manner was more bitter;</p>
			<p>For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,<br/>
			By which they so intensely heated were,<br/>
			That iron more so asks not any art.</p>
			<p>All of their coverings uplifted were,<br/>
			And from them issued forth such dire laments,<br/>
			Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.</p>
			<p>And I: "My Master, what are all those people<br/>
			Who, having sepulture within those tombs,<br/>
			Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Here are the Heresiarchs,<br/>
			With their disciples of all sects, and much<br/>
			More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.</p>
			<p>Here like together with its like is buried;<br/>
			And more and less the monuments are heated."<br/>
			And when he to the right had turned, we passed</p>
			<p>Between the torments and high parapets.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto X</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Now onward goes, along a narrow path<br/>
			Between the torments and the city wall,<br/>
			My Master, and I follow at his back.</p>
			<p>"O power supreme, that through these impious circles<br/>
			Turnest me," I began, "as pleases thee,<br/>
			Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;</p>
			<p>The people who are lying in these tombs,<br/>
			Might they be seen? already are uplifted<br/>
			The covers all, and no one keepeth guard."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "They all will be closed up<br/>
			When from Jehoshaphat they shall return<br/>
			Here with the bodies they have left above.</p>
			<p>Their cemetery have upon this side<br/>
			With Epicurus all his followers,<br/>
			Who with the body mortal make the soul;</p>
			<p>But in the question thou dost put to me,<br/>
			Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,<br/>
			And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent."</p>
			<p>And I: "Good Leader, I but keep concealed<br/>
			From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,<br/>
			Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me."</p>
			<p>"O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire<br/>
			Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,<br/>
			Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.</p>
			<p>Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest<br/>
			A native of that noble fatherland,<br/>
			To which perhaps I too molestful was."</p>
			<p>Upon a sudden issued forth this sound<br/>
			From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,<br/>
			Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.</p>
			<p>And unto me he said: "Turn thee; what dost thou?<br/>
			Behold there Farinata who has risen;<br/>
			From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him."</p>
			<p>I had already fixed mine eyes on his,<br/>
			And he uprose erect with breast and front<br/>
			E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.</p>
			<p>And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader<br/>
			Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,<br/>
			Exclaiming, "Let thy words explicit be."</p>
			<p>As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb<br/>
			Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,<br/>
			Then asked of me, "Who were thine ancestors?"</p>
			<p>I, who desirous of obeying was,<br/>
			Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;<br/>
			Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.</p>
			<p>Then said he: "Fiercely adverse have they been<br/>
			To me, and to my fathers, and my party;<br/>
			So that two several times I scattered them."</p>
			<p>"If they were banished, they returned on all sides,"<br/>
			I answered him, "the first time and the second;<br/>
			But yours have not acquired that art aright."</p>
			<p>Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered<br/>
			Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;<br/>
			I think that he had risen on his knees.</p>
			<p>Round me he gazed, as if solicitude<br/>
			He had to see if some one else were with me,<br/>
			But after his suspicion was all spent,</p>
			<p>Weeping, he said to me: "If through this blind<br/>
			Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,<br/>
			Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?"</p>
			<p>And I to him: "I come not of myself;<br/>
			He who is waiting yonder leads me here,<br/>
			Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had."</p>
			<p>His language and the mode of punishment<br/>
			Already unto me had read his name;<br/>
			On that account my answer was so full.</p>
			<p>Up starting suddenly, he cried out: "How<br/>
			Saidst thou,—he had?  Is he not still alive?<br/>
			Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?"</p>
			<p>When he became aware of some delay,<br/>
			Which I before my answer made, supine<br/>
			He fell again, and forth appeared no more.</p>
			<p>But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire<br/>
			I had remained, did not his aspect change,<br/>
			Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.</p>
			<p>"And if," continuing his first discourse,<br/>
			"They have that art," he said, "not learned aright,<br/>
			That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.</p>
			<p>But fifty times shall not rekindled be<br/>
			The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,<br/>
			Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;</p>
			<p>And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,<br/>
			Say why that people is so pitiless<br/>
			Against my race in each one of its laws?"</p>
			<p>Whence I to him: "The slaughter and great carnage<br/>
			Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause<br/>
			Such orisons in our temple to be made."</p>
			<p>After his head he with a sigh had shaken,<br/>
			"There I was not alone," he said, "nor surely<br/>
			Without a cause had with the others moved.</p>
			<p>But there I was alone, where every one<br/>
			Consented to the laying waste of Florence,<br/>
			He who defended her with open face."</p>
			<p>"Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,"<br/>
			I him entreated, "solve for me that knot,<br/>
			Which has entangled my conceptions here.</p>
			<p>It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,<br/>
			Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,<br/>
			And in the present have another mode."</p>
			<p>"We see, like those who have imperfect sight,<br/>
			The things," he said, "that distant are from us;<br/>
			So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.</p>
			<p>When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain<br/>
			Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,<br/>
			Not anything know we of your human state.</p>
			<p>Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead<br/>
			Will be our knowledge from the moment when<br/>
			The portal of the future shall be closed."</p>
			<p>Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,<br/>
			Said: "Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,<br/>
			That still his son is with the living joined.</p>
			<p>And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,<br/>
			Tell him I did it because I was thinking<br/>
			Already of the error you have solved me."</p>
			<p>And now my Master was recalling me,<br/>
			Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit<br/>
			That he would tell me who was with him there.</p>
			<p>He said: "With more than a thousand here I lie;<br/>
			Within here is the second Frederick,<br/>
			And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not."</p>
			<p>Thereon he hid himself; and I towards<br/>
			The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting<br/>
			Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.</p>
			<p>He moved along; and afterward thus going,<br/>
			He said to me, "Why art thou so bewildered?"<br/>
			And I in his inquiry satisfied him.</p>
			<p>"Let memory preserve what thou hast heard<br/>
			Against thyself," that Sage commanded me,<br/>
			"And now attend here;" and he raised his finger.</p>
			<p>"When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet<br/>
			Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,<br/>
			From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life."</p>
			<p>Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;<br/>
			We left the wall, and went towards the middle,<br/>
			Along a path that strikes into a valley,</p>
			<p>Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Upon the margin of a lofty bank<br/>
			Which great rocks broken in a circle made,<br/>
			We came upon a still more cruel throng;</p>
			<p>And there, by reason of the horrible<br/>
			Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,<br/>
			We drew ourselves aside behind the cover</p>
			<p>Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,<br/>
			Which said: "Pope Anastasius I hold,<br/>
			Whom out of the right way Photinus drew."</p>
			<p>"Slow it behoveth our descent to be,<br/>
			So that the sense be first a little used<br/>
			To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it."</p>
			<p>The Master thus; and unto him I said,<br/>
			"Some compensation find, that the time pass not<br/>
			Idly;" and he: "Thou seest I think of that.</p>
			<p>My son, upon the inside of these rocks,"<br/>
			Began he then to say, "are three small circles,<br/>
			From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.</p>
			<p>They all are full of spirits maledict;<br/>
			But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,<br/>
			Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.</p>
			<p>Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,<br/>
			Injury is the end; and all such end<br/>
			Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.</p>
			<p>But because fraud is man's peculiar vice,<br/>
			More it displeases God; and so stand lowest<br/>
			The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.</p>
			<p>All the first circle of the Violent is;<br/>
			But since force may be used against three persons,<br/>
			In three rounds 'tis divided and constructed.</p>
			<p>To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we<br/>
			Use force; I say on them and on their things,<br/>
			As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.</p>
			<p>A death by violence, and painful wounds,<br/>
			Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance<br/>
			Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;</p>
			<p>Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,<br/>
			Marauders, and freebooters, the first round<br/>
			Tormenteth all in companies diverse.</p>
			<p>Man may lay violent hands upon himself<br/>
			And his own goods; and therefore in the second<br/>
			Round must perforce without avail repent</p>
			<p>Whoever of your world deprives himself,<br/>
			Who games, and dissipates his property,<br/>
			And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.</p>
			<p>Violence can be done the Deity,<br/>
			In heart denying and blaspheming Him,<br/>
			And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.</p>
			<p>And for this reason doth the smallest round<br/>
			Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,<br/>
			And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.</p>
			<p>Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,<br/>
			A man may practise upon him who trusts,<br/>
			And him who doth no confidence imburse.</p>
			<p>This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers<br/>
			Only the bond of love which Nature makes;<br/>
			Wherefore within the second circle nestle</p>
			<p>Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,<br/>
			Falsification, theft, and simony,<br/>
			Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.</p>
			<p>By the other mode, forgotten is that love<br/>
			Which Nature makes, and what is after added,<br/>
			From which there is a special faith engendered.</p>
			<p>Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is<br/>
			Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,<br/>
			Whoe'er betrays for ever is consumed."</p>
			<p>And I: "My Master, clear enough proceeds<br/>
			Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes<br/>
			This cavern and the people who possess it.</p>
			<p>But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,<br/>
			Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,<br/>
			And who encounter with such bitter tongues,</p>
			<p>Wherefore are they inside of the red city<br/>
			Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,<br/>
			And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?"</p>
			<p>And unto me he said: "Why wanders so<br/>
			Thine intellect from that which it is wont?<br/>
			Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?</p>
			<p>Hast thou no recollection of those words<br/>
			With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses<br/>
			The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,—</p>
			<p>Incontinence, and Malice, and insane<br/>
			Bestiality? and how Incontinence<br/>
			Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?</p>
			<p>If thou regardest this conclusion well,<br/>
			And to thy mind recallest who they are<br/>
			That up outside are undergoing penance,</p>
			<p>Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons<br/>
			They separated are, and why less wroth<br/>
			Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer."</p>
			<p>"O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,<br/>
			Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,<br/>
			That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!</p>
			<p>Once more a little backward turn thee," said I,<br/>
			"There where thou sayest that usury offends<br/>
			Goodness divine, and disengage the knot."</p>
			<p>"Philosophy," he said, "to him who heeds it,<br/>
			Noteth, not only in one place alone,<br/>
			After what manner Nature takes her course</p>
			<p>From Intellect Divine, and from its art;<br/>
			And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,<br/>
			After not many pages shalt thou find,</p>
			<p>That this your art as far as possible<br/>
			Follows, as the disciple doth the master;<br/>
			So that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild.</p>
			<p>From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind<br/>
			Genesis at the beginning, it behoves<br/>
			Mankind to gain their life and to advance;</p>
			<p>And since the usurer takes another way,<br/>
			Nature herself and in her follower<br/>
			Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.</p>
			<p>But follow, now, as I would fain go on,<br/>
			For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,<br/>
			And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,</p>
			<p>And far beyond there we descend the crag."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">The place where to descend the bank we came<br/>
			Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,<br/>
			Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.</p>
			<p>Such as that ruin is which in the flank<br/>

			Either by earthquake or by failing stay,</p>
			<p>For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,<br/>
			Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,<br/>
			Some path 'twould give to him who was above;</p>
			<p>Even such was the descent of that ravine,<br/>

			<p>Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;<br/>

			<p>My Sage towards him shouted: "Peradventure<br/>
			Thou think'st that here may be the Duke of Athens,<br/>
			Who in the world above brought death to thee?</p>
			<p>Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not<br/>
			Instructed by thy sister, but he comes<br/>
			In order to behold your punishments."</p>
			<p>As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment<br/>
			In which he has received the mortal blow,<br/>
			Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,</p>
			<p>The Minotaur beheld I do the like;<br/>
			And he, the wary, cried: "Run to the passage;<br/>
			While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend."</p>
			<p>Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge<br/>
			Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves<br/>
			Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.</p>
			<p>Thoughtful I went; and he said: "Thou art thinking<br/>
			Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded<br/>
			By that brute anger which just now I quenched.</p>
			<p>Now will I have thee know, the other time<br/>
			I here descended to the nether Hell,<br/>
			This precipice had not yet fallen down.</p>
			<p>But truly, if I well discern, a little<br/>
			Before His coming who the mighty spoil<br/>
			Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,</p>
			<p>Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley<br/>
			Trembled so, that I thought the Universe<br/>
			Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think</p>
			<p>The world ofttimes converted into chaos;<br/>
			And at that moment this primeval crag<br/>
			Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.</p>
			<p>But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near<br/>
			The river of blood, within which boiling is<br/>
			Whoe'er by violence doth injure others."</p>
			<p>O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,<br/>
			That spurs us onward so in our short life,<br/>
			And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!</p>
			<p>I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,<br/>
			As one which all the plain encompasses,<br/>
			Conformable to what my Guide had said.</p>
			<p>And between this and the embankment's foot<br/>
			Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,<br/>
			As in the world they used the chase to follow.</p>
			<p>Beholding us descend, each one stood still,<br/>
			And from the squadron three detached themselves,<br/>
			With bows and arrows in advance selected;</p>
			<p>And from afar one cried: "Unto what torment<br/>
			Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?<br/>
			Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow."</p>
			<p>My Master said: "Our answer will we make<br/>
			To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,<br/>
			That will of thine was evermore so hasty."</p>
			<p>Then touched he me, and said: "This one is Nessus,<br/>
			Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,<br/>
			And for himself, himself did vengeance take.</p>
			<p>And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,<br/>
			Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;<br/>
			That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.</p>
			<p>Thousands and thousands go about the moat<br/>
			Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges<br/>
			Out of the blood, more than his crime allots."</p>
			<p>Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;<br/>
			Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch<br/>
			Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.</p>
			<p>After he had uncovered his great mouth,<br/>
			He said to his companions: "Are you ware<br/>
			That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?</p>
			<p>Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men."<br/>
			And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,<br/>
			Where the two natures are together joined,</p>
			<p>Replied: "Indeed he lives, and thus alone<br/>
			Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;<br/>
			Necessity, and not delight, impels us.</p>
			<p>Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,<br/>
			Who unto me committed this new office;<br/>
			No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.</p>
			<p>But by that virtue through which I am moving<br/>
			My steps along this savage thoroughfare,<br/>
			Give us some one of thine, to be with us,</p>
			<p>And who may show us where to pass the ford,<br/>
			And who may carry this one on his back;<br/>
			For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air."</p>
			<p>Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,<br/>
			And said to Nessus: "Turn and do thou guide them,<br/>
			And warn aside, if other band may meet you."</p>
			<p>We with our faithful escort onward moved<br/>
			Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,<br/>
			Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.</p>
			<p>People I saw within up to the eyebrows,<br/>
			And the great Centaur said: "Tyrants are these,<br/>
			Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.</p>
			<p>Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here<br/>
			Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius<br/>
			Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.</p>
			<p>That forehead there which has the hair so black<br/>
			Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,<br/>
			Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,</p>
			<p>Up in the world was by his stepson slain."<br/>
			Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,<br/>
			"Now he be first to thee, and second I."</p>
			<p>A little farther on the Centaur stopped<br/>
			Above a folk, who far down as the throat<br/>
			Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.</p>
			<p>A shade he showed us on one side alone,<br/>
			Saying: "He cleft asunder in God's bosom<br/>
			The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured."</p>
			<p>Then people saw I, who from out the river<br/>
			Lifted their heads and also all the chest;<br/>
			And many among these I recognised.</p>
			<p>Thus ever more and more grew shallower<br/>
			That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;<br/>
			And there across the moat our passage was.</p>
			<p>"Even as thou here upon this side beholdest<br/>
			The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,"<br/>
			The Centaur said, "I wish thee to believe</p>
			<p>That on this other more and more declines<br/>
			Its bed, until it reunites itself<br/>
			Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.</p>
			<p>Justice divine, upon this side, is goading<br/>
			That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,<br/>
			And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks</p>
			<p>The tears which with the boiling it unseals<br/>
			In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,<br/>
			Who made upon the highways so much war."</p>
			<p>Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,<br/>
			When we had put ourselves within a wood,<br/>
			That was not marked by any path whatever.</p>
			<p>Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,<br/>
			Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,<br/>
			Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.</p>
			<p>Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,<br/>
			Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold<br/>
			'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.</p>
			<p>There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,<br/>
			Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,<br/>
			With sad announcement of impending doom;</p>
			<p>Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,<br/>
			And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;<br/>
			They make laments upon the wondrous trees.</p>
			<p>And the good Master: "Ere thou enter farther,<br/>
			Know that thou art within the second round,"<br/>
			Thus he began to say, "and shalt be, till</p>
			<p>Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;<br/>
			Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see<br/>
			Things that will credence give unto my speech."</p>
			<p>I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,<br/>
			And person none beheld I who might make them,<br/>
			Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.</p>
			<p>I think he thought that I perhaps might think<br/>
			So many voices issued through those trunks<br/>
			From people who concealed themselves from us;</p>
			<p>Therefore the Master said: "If thou break off<br/>
			Some little spray from any of these trees,<br/>
			The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain."</p>
			<p>Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,<br/>
			And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;<br/>
			And the trunk cried, "Why dost thou mangle me?"</p>
			<p>After it had become embrowned with blood,<br/>
			It recommenced its cry: "Why dost thou rend me?<br/>
			Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?</p>
			<p>Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;<br/>
			Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,<br/>
			Even if the souls of serpents we had been."</p>
			<p>As out of a green brand, that is on fire<br/>
			At one of the ends, and from the other drips<br/>
			And hisses with the wind that is escaping;</p>
			<p>So from that splinter issued forth together<br/>
			Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip<br/>
			Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.</p>
			<p>"Had he been able sooner to believe,"<br/>
			My Sage made answer, "O thou wounded soul,<br/>
			What only in my verses he has seen,</p>
			<p>Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;<br/>
			Whereas the thing incredible has caused me<br/>
			To put him to an act which grieveth me.</p>
			<p>But tell him who thou wast, so that by way<br/>
			Of some amends thy fame he may refresh<br/>
			Up in the world, to which he can return."</p>
			<p>And the trunk said: "So thy sweet words allure me,<br/>
			I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,<br/>
			That I a little to discourse am tempted.</p>
			<p>I am the one who both keys had in keeping<br/>
			Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro<br/>
			So softly in unlocking and in locking,</p>
			<p>That from his secrets most men I withheld;<br/>
			Fidelity I bore the glorious office<br/>
			So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.</p>
			<p>The courtesan who never from the dwelling<br/>
			Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,<br/>
			Death universal and the vice of courts,</p>
			<p>Inflamed against me all the other minds,<br/>
			And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,<br/>
			That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.</p>
			<p>My spirit, in disdainful exultation,<br/>
			Thinking by dying to escape disdain,<br/>
			Made me unjust against myself, the just.</p>
			<p>I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,<br/>
			Do swear to you that never broke I faith<br/>
			Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;</p>
			<p>And to the world if one of you return,<br/>
			Let him my memory comfort, which is lying<br/>
			Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it."</p>
			<p>Waited awhile, and then: "Since he is silent,"<br/>
			The Poet said to me, "lose not the time,<br/>
			But speak, and question him, if more may please thee."</p>
			<p>Whence I to him: "Do thou again inquire<br/>
			Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;<br/>
			For I cannot, such pity is in my heart."</p>
			<p>Therefore he recommenced: "So may the man<br/>
			Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,<br/>
			Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased</p>
			<p>To tell us in what way the soul is bound<br/>
			Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,<br/>
			If any from such members e'er is freed."</p>
			<p>Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward<br/>
			The wind was into such a voice converted:<br/>
			"With brevity shall be replied to you.</p>
			<p>When the exasperated soul abandons<br/>
			The body whence it rent itself away,<br/>
			Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.</p>
			<p>It falls into the forest, and no part<br/>
			Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,<br/>
			There like a grain of spelt it germinates.</p>
			<p>It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;<br/>
			The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,<br/>
			Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.</p>
			<p>Like others for our spoils shall we return;<br/>
			But not that any one may them revest,<br/>
			For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.</p>
			<p>Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal<br/>
			Forest our bodies shall suspended be,<br/>
			Each to the thorn of his molested shade."</p>
			<p>We were attentive still unto the trunk,<br/>
			Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,<br/>
			When by a tumult we were overtaken,</p>
			<p>In the same way as he is who perceives<br/>
			The boar and chase approaching to his stand,<br/>
			Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;</p>
			<p>And two behold! upon our left-hand side,<br/>
			Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,<br/>
			That of the forest, every fan they broke.</p>
			<p>He who was in advance: "Now help, Death, help!"<br/>
			And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,<br/>
			Was shouting: "Lano, were not so alert</p>
			<p>Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!"<br/>
			And then, perchance because his breath was failing,<br/>
			He grouped himself together with a bush.</p>
			<p>Behind them was the forest full of black<br/>
			She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot<br/>
			As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.</p>
			<p>On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,<br/>
			And him they lacerated piece by piece,<br/>
			Thereafter bore away those aching members.</p>
			<p>Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,<br/>
			And led me to the bush, that all in vain<br/>
			Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.</p>
			<p>"O Jacopo," it said, "of Sant' Andrea,<br/>
			What helped it thee of me to make a screen?<br/>
			What blame have I in thy nefarious life?"</p>
			<p>When near him had the Master stayed his steps,<br/>
			He said: "Who wast thou, that through wounds so many<br/>
			Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?"</p>
			<p>And he to us: "O souls, that hither come<br/>
			To look upon the shameful massacre<br/>
			That has so rent away from me my leaves,</p>
			<p>Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;<br/>
			I of that city was which to the Baptist<br/>
			Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this</p>
			<p>Forever with his art will make it sad.<br/>
			And were it not that on the pass of Arno<br/>
			Some glimpses of him are remaining still,</p>
			<p>Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it<br/>
			Upon the ashes left by Attila,<br/>
			In vain had caused their labour to be done.</p>
			<p>Of my own house I made myself a gibbet."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XIV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Because the charity of my native place<br/>
			Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,<br/>
			And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.</p>
			<p>Then came we to the confine, where disparted<br/>
			The second round is from the third, and where<br/>
			A horrible form of Justice is beheld.</p>
			<p>Clearly to manifest these novel things,<br/>
			I say that we arrived upon a plain,<br/>
			Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;</p>
			<p>The dolorous forest is a garland to it<br/>
			All round about, as the sad moat to that;<br/>
			There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.</p>
			<p>The soil was of an arid and thick sand,<br/>
			Not of another fashion made than that<br/>
			Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.</p>
			<p>Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou<br/>
			By each one to be dreaded, who doth read<br/>
			That which was manifest unto mine eyes!</p>
			<p>Of naked souls beheld I many herds,<br/>
			Who all were weeping very miserably,<br/>
			And over them seemed set a law diverse.</p>
			<p>Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;<br/>
			And some were sitting all drawn up together,<br/>
			And others went about continually.</p>
			<p>Those who were going round were far the more,<br/>
			And those were less who lay down to their torment,<br/>
			But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.</p>
			<p>O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,<br/>
			Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,<br/>
			As of the snow on Alp without a wind.</p>
			<p>As Alexander, in those torrid parts<br/>
			Of India, beheld upon his host<br/>
			Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.</p>
			<p>Whence he provided with his phalanxes<br/>
			To trample down the soil, because the vapour<br/>
			Better extinguished was while it was single;</p>
			<p>Thus was descending the eternal heat,<br/>
			Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder<br/>
			Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.</p>
			<p>Without repose forever was the dance<br/>
			Of miserable hands, now there, now here,<br/>
			Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.</p>
			<p>"Master," began I, "thou who overcomest<br/>
			All things except the demons dire, that issued<br/>
			Against us at the entrance of the gate,</p>
			<p>Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not<br/>
			The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,<br/>
			So that the rain seems not to ripen him?"</p>
			<p>And he himself, who had become aware<br/>
			That I was questioning my Guide about him,<br/>
			Cried: "Such as I was living, am I, dead.</p>
			<p>If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom<br/>
			He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,<br/>
			Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,</p>
			<p>And if he wearied out by turns the others<br/>
			In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,<br/>
			Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'</p>
			<p>Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,<br/>
			And shot his bolts at me with all his might,<br/>
			He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance."</p>
			<p>Then did my Leader speak with such great force,<br/>
			That I had never heard him speak so loud:<br/>
			"O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished</p>
			<p>Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;<br/>
			Not any torment, saving thine own rage,<br/>
			Would be unto thy fury pain complete."</p>
			<p>Then he turned round to me with better lip,<br/>
			Saying: "One of the Seven Kings was he<br/>
			Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold</p>
			<p>God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;<br/>
			But, as I said to him, his own despites<br/>
			Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.</p>
			<p>Now follow me, and mind thou do not place<br/>
			As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,<br/>
			But always keep them close unto the wood."</p>
			<p>Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes<br/>
			Forth from the wood a little rivulet,<br/>
			Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.</p>
			<p>As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,<br/>
			The sinful women later share among them,<br/>
			So downward through the sand it went its way.</p>
			<p>The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,<br/>
			Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;<br/>
			Whence I perceived that there the passage was.</p>
			<p>"In all the rest which I have shown to thee<br/>
			Since we have entered in within the gate<br/>
			Whose threshold unto no one is denied,</p>
			<p>Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes<br/>
			So notable as is the present river,<br/>
			Which all the little flames above it quenches."</p>
			<p>These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him<br/>
			That he would give me largess of the food,<br/>
			For which he had given me largess of desire.</p>
			<p>"In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,"<br/>
			Said he thereafterward, "whose name is Crete,<br/>
			Under whose king the world of old was chaste.</p>
			<p>There is a mountain there, that once was glad<br/>
			With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;<br/>
			Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out.</p>
			<p>Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle<br/>
			Of her own son; and to conceal him better,<br/>
			Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made.</p>
			<p>A grand old man stands in the mount erect,<br/>
			Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta,<br/>
			And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.</p>
			<p>His head is fashioned of refined gold,<br/>
			And of pure silver are the arms and breast;<br/>
			Then he is brass as far down as the fork.</p>
			<p>From that point downward all is chosen iron,<br/>
			Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,<br/>
			And more he stands on that than on the other.</p>
			<p>Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure<br/>
			Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,<br/>
			Which gathered together perforate that cavern.</p>
			<p>From rock to rock they fall into this valley;<br/>
			Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;<br/>
			Then downward go along this narrow sluice</p>
			<p>Unto that point where is no more descending.<br/>
			They form Cocytus; what that pool may be<br/>
			Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated."</p>
			<p>And I to him: "If so the present runnel<br/>
			Doth take its rise in this way from our world,<br/>
			Why only on this verge appears it to us?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Thou knowest the place is round,<br/>
			And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,<br/>
			Still to the left descending to the bottom,</p>
			<p>Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.<br/>
			Therefore if something new appear to us,<br/>
			It should not bring amazement to thy face."</p>
			<p>And I again: "Master, where shall be found<br/>
			Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,<br/>
			And sayest the other of this rain is made?"</p>
			<p>"In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,"<br/>
			Replied he; "but the boiling of the red<br/>
			Water might well solve one of them thou makest.</p>
			<p>Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,<br/>
			There where the souls repair to lave themselves,<br/>
			When sin repented of has been removed."</p>
			<p>Then said he: "It is time now to abandon<br/>
			The wood; take heed that thou come after me;<br/>
			A way the margins make that are not burning,</p>
			<p>And over them all vapours are extinguished."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,<br/>
			And so the brooklet's mist o'ershadows it,<br/>
			From fire it saves the water and the dikes.</p>
			<p>Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges,<br/>
			Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself,<br/>
			Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;</p>
			<p>And as the Paduans along the Brenta,<br/>
			To guard their villas and their villages,<br/>
			Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;</p>
			<p>In such similitude had those been made,<br/>
			Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,<br/>
			Whoever he might be, the master made them.</p>
			<p>Now were we from the forest so remote,<br/>
			I could not have discovered where it was,<br/>
			Even if backward I had turned myself,</p>
			<p>When we a company of souls encountered,<br/>
			Who came beside the dike, and every one<br/>
			Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont</p>
			<p>To eye each other under a new moon,<br/>
			And so towards us sharpened they their brows<br/>
			As an old tailor at the needle's eye.</p>
			<p>Thus scrutinised by such a family,<br/>
			By some one I was recognised, who seized<br/>
			My garment's hem, and cried out, "What a marvel!"</p>
			<p>And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,<br/>
			On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,<br/>
			That the scorched countenance prevented not</p>
			<p>His recognition by my intellect;<br/>
			And bowing down my face unto his own,<br/>
			I made reply, "Are you here, Ser Brunetto?"</p>
			<p>And he: "May't not displease thee, O my son,<br/>
			If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini<br/>
			Backward return and let the trail go on."</p>
			<p>I said to him: "With all my power I ask it;<br/>
			And if you wish me to sit down with you,<br/>
			I will, if he please, for I go with him."</p>
			<p>"O son," he said, "whoever of this herd<br/>
			A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,<br/>
			Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.</p>
			<p>Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,<br/>
			And afterward will I rejoin my band,<br/>
			Which goes lamenting its eternal doom."</p>
			<p>I did not dare to go down from the road<br/>
			Level to walk with him; but my head bowed<br/>
			I held as one who goeth reverently.</p>
			<p>And he began: "What fortune or what fate<br/>
			Before the last day leadeth thee down here?<br/>
			And who is this that showeth thee the way?"</p>
			<p>"Up there above us in the life serene,"<br/>
			I answered him, "I lost me in a valley,<br/>
			Or ever yet my age had been completed.</p>
			<p>But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;<br/>
			This one appeared to me, returning thither,<br/>
			And homeward leadeth me along this road."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "If thou thy star do follow,<br/>
			Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,<br/>
			If well I judged in the life beautiful.</p>
			<p>And if I had not died so prematurely,<br/>
			Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,<br/>
			I would have given thee comfort in the work.</p>
			<p>But that ungrateful and malignant people,<br/>
			Which of old time from Fesole descended,<br/>
			And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,</p>
			<p>Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;<br/>
			And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs<br/>
			It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.</p>
			<p>Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;<br/>
			A people avaricious, envious, proud;<br/>
			Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.</p>
			<p>Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,<br/>
			One party and the other shall be hungry<br/>
			For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.</p>
			<p>Their litter let the beasts of Fesole<br/>
			Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,<br/>
			If any still upon their dunghill rise,</p>
			<p>In which may yet revive the consecrated<br/>
			Seed of those Romans, who remained there when<br/>
			The nest of such great malice it became."</p>
			<p>"If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,"<br/>
			Replied I to him, "not yet would you be<br/>
			In banishment from human nature placed;</p>
			<p>For in my mind is fixed, and touches now<br/>
			My heart the dear and good paternal image<br/>
			Of you, when in the world from hour to hour</p>
			<p>You taught me how a man becomes eternal;<br/>
			And how much I am grateful, while I live<br/>
			Behoves that in my language be discerned.</p>
			<p>What you narrate of my career I write,<br/>
			And keep it to be glossed with other text<br/>
			By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.</p>
			<p>This much will I have manifest to you;<br/>
			Provided that my conscience do not chide me,<br/>
			For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.</p>
			<p>Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;<br/>
			Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around<br/>
			As it may please her, and the churl his mattock."</p>
			<p>My Master thereupon on his right cheek<br/>
			Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;<br/>
			Then said: "He listeneth well who noteth it."</p>
			<p>Nor speaking less on that account, I go<br/>
			With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are<br/>
			His most known and most eminent companions.</p>
			<p>And he to me: "To know of some is well;<br/>
			Of others it were laudable to be silent,<br/>
			For short would be the time for so much speech.</p>
			<p>Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,<br/>
			And men of letters great and of great fame,<br/>
			In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.</p>
			<p>Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,<br/>
			And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there<br/>
			If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,</p>
			<p>That one, who by the Servant of the Servants<br/>
			From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,<br/>
			Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.</p>
			<p>More would I say, but coming and discoursing<br/>
			Can be no longer; for that I behold<br/>
			New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.</p>
			<p>A people comes with whom I may not be;<br/>
			Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,<br/>
			In which I still live, and no more I ask."</p>
			<p>Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those<br/>
			Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle<br/>
			Across the plain; and seemed to be among them</p>
			<p>The one who wins, and not the one who loses.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XVI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Now was I where was heard the reverberation<br/>
			Of water falling into the next round,<br/>
			Like to that humming which the beehives make,</p>
			<p>When shadows three together started forth,<br/>
			Running, from out a company that passed<br/>
			Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.</p>
			<p>Towards us came they, and each one cried out:<br/>
			"Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest<br/>
			To be some one of our depraved city."</p>
			<p>Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,<br/>
			Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!<br/>
			It pains me still but to remember it.</p>
			<p>Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;<br/>
			He turned his face towards me, and "Now wait,"<br/>
			He said; "to these we should be courteous.</p>
			<p>And if it were not for the fire that darts<br/>
			The nature of this region, I should say<br/>
			That haste were more becoming thee than them."</p>
			<p>As soon as we stood still, they recommenced<br/>
			The old refrain, and when they overtook us,<br/>
			Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.</p>
			<p>As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,<br/>
			Watching for their advantage and their hold,<br/>
			Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,</p>
			<p>Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage<br/>
			Direct to me, so that in opposite wise<br/>
			His neck and feet continual journey made.</p>
			<p>And, "If the misery of this soft place<br/>
			Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,"<br/>
			Began one, "and our aspect black and blistered,</p>
			<p>Let the renown of us thy mind incline<br/>
			To tell us who thou art, who thus securely<br/>
			Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.</p>
			<p>He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,<br/>
			Naked and skinless though he now may go,<br/>
			Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;</p>
			<p>He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;<br/>
			His name was Guidoguerra, and in life<br/>
			Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.</p>
			<p>The other, who close by me treads the sand,<br/>
			Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame<br/>
			Above there in the world should welcome be.</p>
			<p>And I, who with them on the cross am placed,<br/>
			Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly<br/>
			My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me."</p>
			<p>Could I have been protected from the fire,<br/>
			Below I should have thrown myself among them,<br/>
			And think the Teacher would have suffered it;</p>
			<p>But as I should have burned and baked myself,<br/>
			My terror overmastered my good will,<br/>
			Which made me greedy of embracing them.</p>
			<p>Then I began: "Sorrow and not disdain<br/>
			Did your condition fix within me so,<br/>
			That tardily it wholly is stripped off,</p>
			<p>As soon as this my Lord said unto me<br/>
			Words, on account of which I thought within me<br/>
			That people such as you are were approaching.</p>
			<p>I of your city am; and evermore<br/>
			Your labours and your honourable names<br/>
			I with affection have retraced and heard.</p>
			<p>I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits<br/>
			Promised to me by the veracious Leader;<br/>
			But to the centre first I needs must plunge."</p>
			<p>"So may the soul for a long while conduct<br/>
			Those limbs of thine," did he make answer then,<br/>
			"And so may thy renown shine after thee,</p>
			<p>Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell<br/>
			Within our city, as they used to do,<br/>
			Or if they wholly have gone out of it;</p>
			<p>For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment<br/>
			With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,<br/>
			Doth greatly mortify us with his words."</p>
			<p>"The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,<br/>
			Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,<br/>
			Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!"</p>
			<p>In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;<br/>
			And the three, taking that for my reply,<br/>
			Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.</p>
			<p>"If other times so little it doth cost thee,"<br/>
			Replied they all, "to satisfy another,<br/>
			Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!</p>
			<p>Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,<br/>
			And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,<br/>
			When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'</p>
			<p>See that thou speak of us unto the people."<br/>
			Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight<br/>
			It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.</p>
			<p>Not an Amen could possibly be said<br/>
			So rapidly as they had disappeared;<br/>
			Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.</p>
			<p>I followed him, and little had we gone,<br/>
			Before the sound of water was so near us,<br/>
			That speaking we should hardly have been heard.</p>
			<p>Even as that stream which holdeth its own course<br/>
			The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,<br/>
			Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,</p>
			<p>Which is above called Acquacheta, ere<br/>
			It down descendeth into its low bed,<br/>
			And at Forli is vacant of that name,</p>
			<p>Reverberates there above San Benedetto<br/>
			From Alps, by falling at a single leap,<br/>
			Where for a thousand there were room enough;</p>
			<p>Thus downward from a bank precipitate,<br/>
			We found resounding that dark-tinted water,<br/>
			So that it soon the ear would have offended.</p>
			<p>I had a cord around about me girt,<br/>
			And therewithal I whilom had designed<br/>
			To take the panther with the painted skin.</p>
			<p>After I this had all from me unloosed,<br/>
			As my Conductor had commanded me,<br/>
			I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,</p>
			<p>Whereat he turned himself to the right side,<br/>
			And at a little distance from the verge,<br/>
			He cast it down into that deep abyss.</p>
			<p>"It must needs be some novelty respond,"<br/>
			I said within myself, "to the new signal<br/>
			The Master with his eye is following so."</p>
			<p>Ah me! how very cautious men should be<br/>
			With those who not alone behold the act,<br/>
			But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!</p>
			<p>He said to me: "Soon there will upward come<br/>
			What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming<br/>
			Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight."</p>
			<p>Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,<br/>
			A man should close his lips as far as may be,<br/>
			Because without his fault it causes shame;</p>
			<p>But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes<br/>
			Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,<br/>
			So may they not be void of lasting favour,</p>
			<p>Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere<br/>
			I saw a figure swimming upward come,<br/>
			Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,</p>
			<p>Even as he returns who goeth down<br/>
			Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled<br/>
			Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,</p>
			<p>Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XVII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">"Behold the monster with the pointed tail,<br/>
			Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,<br/>
			Behold him who infecteth all the world."</p>
			<p>Thus unto me my Guide began to say,<br/>
			And beckoned him that he should come to shore,<br/>
			Near to the confine of the trodden marble;</p>
			<p>And that uncleanly image of deceit<br/>
			Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,<br/>
			But on the border did not drag its tail.</p>
			<p>The face was as the face of a just man,<br/>
			Its semblance outwardly was so benign,<br/>
			And of a serpent all the trunk beside.</p>
			<p>Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;<br/>
			The back, and breast, and both the sides it had<br/>
			Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.</p>
			<p>With colours more, groundwork or broidery<br/>
			Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,<br/>
			Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.</p>
			<p>As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,<br/>
			That part are in the water, part on land;<br/>
			And as among the guzzling Germans there,</p>
			<p>The beaver plants himself to wage his war;<br/>
			So that vile monster lay upon the border,<br/>
			Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.</p>
			<p>His tail was wholly quivering in the void,<br/>
			Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,<br/>
			That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.</p>
			<p>The Guide said: "Now perforce must turn aside<br/>
			Our way a little, even to that beast<br/>
			Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him."</p>
			<p>We therefore on the right side descended,<br/>
			And made ten steps upon the outer verge,<br/>
			Completely to avoid the sand and flame;</p>
			<p>And after we are come to him, I see<br/>
			A little farther off upon the sand<br/>
			A people sitting near the hollow place.</p>
			<p>Then said to me the Master: "So that full<br/>
			Experience of this round thou bear away,<br/>
			Now go and see what their condition is.</p>
			<p>There let thy conversation be concise;<br/>
			Till thou returnest I will speak with him,<br/>
			That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders."</p>
			<p>Thus farther still upon the outermost<br/>
			Head of that seventh circle all alone<br/>
			I went, where sat the melancholy folk.</p>
			<p>Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;<br/>
			This way, that way, they helped them with their hands<br/>
			Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.</p>
			<p>Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,<br/>
			Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when<br/>
			By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.</p>
			<p>When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces<br/>
			Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,<br/>
			Not one of them I knew; but I perceived</p>
			<p>That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,<br/>
			Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;<br/>
			And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.</p>
			<p>And as I gazing round me come among them,<br/>
			Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw<br/>
			That had the face and posture of a lion.</p>
			<p>Proceeding then the current of my sight,<br/>
			Another of them saw I, red as blood,<br/>
			Display a goose more white than butter is.</p>
			<p>And one, who with an azure sow and gravid<br/>
			Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,<br/>
			Said unto me: "What dost thou in this moat?</p>
			<p>Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,<br/>
			Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,<br/>
			Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.</p>
			<p>A Paduan am I with these Florentines;<br/>
			Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,<br/>
			Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,</p>
			<p>He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'"<br/>
			Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust<br/>
			His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.</p>
			<p>And fearing lest my longer stay might vex<br/>
			Him who had warned me not to tarry long,<br/>
			Backward I turned me from those weary souls.</p>
			<p>I found my Guide, who had already mounted<br/>
			Upon the back of that wild animal,<br/>
			And said to me: "Now be both strong and bold.</p>
			<p>Now we descend by stairways such as these;<br/>
			Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,<br/>
			So that the tail may have no power to harm thee."</p>
			<p>Such as he is who has so near the ague<br/>
			Of quartan that his nails are blue already,<br/>
			And trembles all, but looking at the shade;</p>
			<p>Even such became I at those proffered words;<br/>
			But shame in me his menaces produced,<br/>
			Which maketh servant strong before good master.</p>
			<p>I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;<br/>
			I wished to say, and yet the voice came not<br/>
			As I believed, "Take heed that thou embrace me."</p>
			<p>But he, who other times had rescued me<br/>
			In other peril, soon as I had mounted,<br/>
			Within his arms encircled and sustained me,</p>
			<p>And said: "Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;<br/>
			The circles large, and the descent be little;<br/>
			Think of the novel burden which thou hast."</p>
			<p>Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,<br/>
			Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;<br/>
			And when he wholly felt himself afloat,</p>
			<p>There where his breast had been he turned his tail,<br/>
			And that extended like an eel he moved,<br/>
			And with his paws drew to himself the air.</p>
			<p>A greater fear I do not think there was<br/>
			What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,<br/>
			Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;</p>
			<p>Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks<br/>
			Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,<br/>
			His father crying, "An ill way thou takest!"</p>
			<p>Than was my own, when I perceived myself<br/>
			On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished<br/>
			The sight of everything but of the monster.</p>
			<p>Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;<br/>
			Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only<br/>
			By wind upon my face and from below.</p>
			<p>I heard already on the right the whirlpool<br/>
			Making a horrible crashing under us;<br/>
			Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.</p>
			<p>Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;<br/>
			Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,<br/>
			Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.</p>
			<p>I saw then, for before I had not seen it,<br/>
			The turning and descending, by great horrors<br/>
			That were approaching upon divers sides.</p>
			<p>As falcon who has long been on the wing,<br/>
			Who, without seeing either lure or bird,<br/>
			Maketh the falconer say, "Ah me, thou stoopest,"</p>
			<p>Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,<br/>
			Thorough a hundred circles, and alights<br/>
			Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;</p>
			<p>Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,<br/>
			Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,<br/>
			And being disencumbered of our persons,</p>
			<p>He sped away as arrow from the string.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XVIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,<br/>
			Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,<br/>
			As is the circle that around it turns.</p>
			<p>Right in the middle of the field malign<br/>
			There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,<br/>
			Of which its place the structure will recount.</p>
			<p>Round, then, is that enclosure which remains<br/>
			Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,<br/>
			And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.</p>
			<p>As where for the protection of the walls<br/>
			Many and many moats surround the castles,<br/>
			The part in which they are a figure forms,</p>
			<p>Just such an image those presented there;<br/>
			And as about such strongholds from their gates<br/>
			Unto the outer bank are little bridges,</p>
			<p>So from the precipice's base did crags<br/>
			Project, which intersected dikes and moats,<br/>
			Unto the well that truncates and collects them.</p>
			<p>Within this place, down shaken from the back<br/>
			Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet<br/>
			Held to the left, and I moved on behind.</p>
			<p>Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,<br/>
			New torments, and new wielders of the lash,<br/>
			Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.</p>
			<p>Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;<br/>
			This side the middle came they facing us,<br/>
			Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;</p>
			<p>Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,<br/>
			The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,<br/>
			Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;</p>
			<p>For all upon one side towards the Castle<br/>
			Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's;<br/>
			On the other side they go towards the Mountain.</p>
			<p>This side and that, along the livid stone<br/>
			Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,<br/>
			Who cruelly were beating them behind.</p>
			<p>Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs<br/>
			At the first blows! and sooth not any one<br/>
			The second waited for, nor for the third.</p>
			<p>While I was going on, mine eyes by one<br/>
			Encountered were; and straight I said: "Already<br/>
			With sight of this one I am not unfed."</p>
			<p>Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,<br/>
			And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,<br/>
			And to my going somewhat back assented;</p>
			<p>And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,<br/>
			Lowering his face, but little it availed him;<br/>
			For said I: "Thou that castest down thine eyes,</p>
			<p>If false are not the features which thou bearest,<br/>
			Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;<br/>
			But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Unwillingly I tell it;<br/>
			But forces me thine utterance distinct,<br/>
			Which makes me recollect the ancient world.</p>
			<p>I was the one who the fair Ghisola<br/>
			Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,<br/>
			Howe'er the shameless story may be told.</p>
			<p>Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;<br/>
			Nay, rather is this place so full of them,<br/>
			That not so many tongues to-day are taught</p>
			<p>'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'<br/>
			And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,<br/>
			Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart."</p>
			<p>While speaking in this manner, with his scourge<br/>
			A demon smote him, and said: "Get thee gone<br/>
			Pander, there are no women here for coin."</p>
			<p>I joined myself again unto mine Escort;<br/>
			Thereafterward with footsteps few we came<br/>
			To where a crag projected from the bank.</p>
			<p>This very easily did we ascend,<br/>
			And turning to the right along its ridge,<br/>
			From those eternal circles we departed.</p>
			<p>When we were there, where it is hollowed out<br/>
			Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,<br/>
			The Guide said: "Wait, and see that on thee strike</p>
			<p>The vision of those others evil-born,<br/>
			Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,<br/>
			Because together with us they have gone."</p>
			<p>From the old bridge we looked upon the train<br/>
			Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,<br/>
			And which the scourges in like manner smite.</p>
			<p>And the good Master, without my inquiring,<br/>
			Said to me: "See that tall one who is coming,<br/>
			And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;</p>
			<p>Still what a royal aspect he retains!<br/>
			That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning<br/>
			The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.</p>
			<p>He by the isle of Lemnos passed along<br/>
			After the daring women pitiless<br/>
			Had unto death devoted all their males.</p>
			<p>There with his tokens and with ornate words<br/>
			Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden<br/>
			Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.</p>
			<p>There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;<br/>
			Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,<br/>
			And also for Medea is vengeance done.</p>
			<p>With him go those who in such wise deceive;<br/>
			And this sufficient be of the first valley<br/>
			To know, and those that in its jaws it holds."</p>
			<p>We were already where the narrow path<br/>
			Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms<br/>
			Of that a buttress for another arch.</p>
			<p>Thence we heard people, who are making moan<br/>
			In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,<br/>
			And with their palms beating upon themselves</p>
			<p>The margins were incrusted with a mould<br/>
			By exhalation from below, that sticks there,<br/>
			And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.</p>
			<p>The bottom is so deep, no place suffices<br/>
			To give us sight of it, without ascending<br/>
			The arch's back, where most the crag impends.</p>
			<p>Thither we came, and thence down in the moat<br/>
			I saw a people smothered in a filth<br/>
			That out of human privies seemed to flow;</p>
			<p>And whilst below there with mine eye I search,<br/>
			I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,<br/>
			It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.</p>
			<p>He screamed to me: "Wherefore art thou so eager<br/>
			To look at me more than the other foul ones?"<br/>
			And I to him: "Because, if I remember,</p>
			<p>I have already seen thee with dry hair,<br/>
			And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;<br/>
			Therefore I eye thee more than all the others."</p>
			<p>And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:<br/>
			"The flatteries have submerged me here below,<br/>
			Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited."</p>
			<p>Then said to me the Guide: "See that thou thrust<br/>
			Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,<br/>
			That with thine eyes thou well the face attain</p>
			<p>Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,<br/>
			Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,<br/>
			And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.</p>
			<p>Thais the harlot is it, who replied<br/>
			Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I<br/>
			Great gratitude from thee?'—'Nay, marvellous;'</p>
			<p>And herewith let our sight be satisfied."</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 2em">O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,<br/>

			Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.</p>
			<p>We had already on the following tomb<br/>

			<p>Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest<br/>

			<p>To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater<br/>

			<p>And he to me: "If thou wilt have me bear thee<br/>

			<p>And I: "What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;<br/>

			<p>"Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down,<br/>
			O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,"<br/>
			To say began I, "if thou canst, speak out."</p>
			<p>I stood even as the friar who is confessing<br/>
			The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,<br/>
			Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.</p>
			<p>And he cried out: "Dost thou stand there already,<br/>
			Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?<br/>
			By many years the record lied to me.</p>
			<p>Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,<br/>
			For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud<br/>
			The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?"</p>
			<p>Such I became, as people are who stand,<br/>
			Not comprehending what is answered them,<br/>
			As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.</p>
			<p>Then said Virgilius: "Say to him straightway,<br/>
			'I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.'"<br/>
			And I replied as was imposed on me.</p>
			<p>Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,<br/>
			Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation<br/>
			Said to me: "Then what wantest thou of me?</p>
			<p>If who I am thou carest so much to know,<br/>
			That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,<br/>
			Know that I vested was with the great mantle;</p>
			<p>And truly was I son of the She-bear,<br/>
			So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth<br/>
			Above, and here myself, I pocketed.</p>
			<p>Beneath my head the others are dragged down<br/>
			Who have preceded me in simony,<br/>
			Flattened along the fissure of the rock.</p>
			<p>Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever<br/>
			That one shall come who I believed thou wast,<br/>
			What time the sudden question I proposed.</p>
			<p>But longer I my feet already toast,<br/>
			And here have been in this way upside down,<br/>
			Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;</p>
			<p>For after him shall come of fouler deed<br/>
			From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law,<br/>
			Such as befits to cover him and me.</p>
			<p>New Jason will he be, of whom we read<br/>
			In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,<br/>
			So he who governs France shall be to this one."</p>
			<p>I do not know if I were here too bold,<br/>
			That him I answered only in this metre:<br/>
			"I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure</p>
			<p>Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,<br/>
			Before he put the keys into his keeping?<br/>
			Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'</p>
			<p>Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias<br/>
			Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen<br/>
			Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.</p>
			<p>Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,<br/>
			And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,<br/>
			Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.</p>
			<p>And were it not that still forbids it me<br/>
			The reverence for the keys superlative<br/>
			Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,</p>
			<p>I would make use of words more grievous still;<br/>
			Because your avarice afflicts the world,<br/>
			Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.</p>
			<p>The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,<br/>
			When she who sitteth upon many waters<br/>
			To fornicate with kings by him was seen;</p>
			<p>The same who with the seven heads was born,<br/>
			And power and strength from the ten horns received,<br/>
			So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.</p>
			<p>Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;<br/>
			And from the idolater how differ ye,<br/>
			Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?</p>
			<p>Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,<br/>
			Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower<br/>
			Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!"</p>
			<p>And while I sang to him such notes as these,<br/>
			Either that anger or that conscience stung him,<br/>
			He struggled violently with both his feet.</p>
			<p>I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,<br/>
			With such contented lip he listened ever<br/>
			Unto the sound of the true words expressed.</p>
			<p>Therefore with both his arms he took me up,<br/>
			And when he had me all upon his breast,<br/>
			Remounted by the way where he descended.</p>
			<p>Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;<br/>
			But bore me to the summit of the arch<br/>
			Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.</p>
			<p>There tenderly he laid his burden down,<br/>
			Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,<br/>
			That would have been hard passage for the goats:</p>
			<p>Thence was unveiled to me another valley.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XX</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Of a new pain behoves me to make verses<br/>

			<p>I was already thoroughly disposed<br/>

			Which bathed itself with tears of agony;</p>
			<p>And people saw I through the circular valley,<br/>
			Silent and weeping, coming at the pace<br/>
			Which in this world the Litanies assume.</p>
			<p>As lower down my sight descended on them,<br/>
			Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted<br/>
			From chin to the beginning of the chest;</p>
			<p>For tow'rds the reins the countenance was turned,<br/>

			<p>Perchance indeed by violence of palsy<br/>

			<p>Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak<br/>
			Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said<br/>
			To me: "Art thou, too, of the other fools?</p>
			<p>Here pity lives when it is wholly dead;<br/>
			Who is a greater reprobate than he<br/>
			Who feels compassion at the doom divine?</p>
			<p>Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom<br/>
			Opened the earth before the Thebans' eyes;<br/>
			Wherefore they all cried: 'Whither rushest thou,</p>
			<p>Amphiaraus?  Why dost leave the war?'<br/>
			And downward ceased he not to fall amain<br/>
			As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.</p>
			<p>See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!<br/>
			Because he wished to see too far before him<br/>
			Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:</p>
			<p>Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,<br/>
			When from a male a female he became,<br/>
			His members being all of them transformed;</p>
			<p>And afterwards was forced to strike once more<br/>

			Ere he could have again his manly plumes.</p>
			<p>That Aruns is, who backs the other's belly,<br/>
			Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs<br/>
			The Carrarese who houses underneath,</p>
			<p>Among the marbles white a cavern had<br/>
			For his abode; whence to behold the stars<br/>
			And sea, the view was not cut off from him.</p>
			<p>And she there, who is covering up her breasts,<br/>
			Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,<br/>
			And on that side has all the hairy skin,</p>
			<p>Was Manto, who made quest through many lands,<br/>
			Afterwards tarried there where I was born;<br/>
			Whereof I would thou list to me a little.</p>
			<p>After her father had from life departed,<br/>
			And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,<br/>
			She a long season wandered through the world.</p>
			<p>Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake<br/>
			At the Alp's foot that shuts in Germany<br/>
			Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.</p>
			<p>By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,<br/>
			'Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,<br/>
			With water that grows stagnant in that lake.</p>
			<p>Midway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,<br/>
			And he of Brescia, and the Veronese<br/>
			Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.</p>
			<p>Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,<br/>
			To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,<br/>
			Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.</p>
			<p>There of necessity must fall whatever<br/>
			In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,<br/>
			And grows a river down through verdant pastures.</p>
			<p>Soon as the water doth begin to run,<br/>
			No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,<br/>
			Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.</p>
			<p>Not far it runs before it finds a plain<br/>
			In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,<br/>
			And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly.</p>
			<p>Passing that way the virgin pitiless<br/>
			Land in the middle of the fen descried,<br/>
			Untilled and naked of inhabitants;</p>
			<p>There to escape all human intercourse,<br/>
			She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise<br/>
			And lived, and left her empty body there.</p>
			<p>The men, thereafter, who were scattered round,<br/>
			Collected in that place, which was made strong<br/>
			By the lagoon it had on every side;</p>
			<p>They built their city over those dead bones,<br/>
			And, after her who first the place selected,<br/>
			Mantua named it, without other omen.</p>
			<p>Its people once within more crowded were,<br/>
			Ere the stupidity of Casalodi<br/>
			From Pinamonte had received deceit.</p>
			<p>Therefore I caution thee, if e'er thou hearest<br/>
			Originate my city otherwise,<br/>
			No falsehood may the verity defraud."</p>
			<p>And I: "My Master, thy discourses are<br/>
			To me so certain, and so take my faith,<br/>
			That unto me the rest would be spent coals.</p>
			<p>But tell me of the people who are passing,<br/>
			If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,<br/>
			For only unto that my mind reverts."</p>
			<p>Then said he to me: "He who from the cheek<br/>
			Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders<br/>
			Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,</p>
			<p>So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,<br/>
			An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,<br/>
			In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.</p>
			<p>Eryphylus his name was, and so sings<br/>
			My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;<br/>
			That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.</p>
			<p>The next, who is so slender in the flanks,<br/>
			Was Michael Scott, who of a verity<br/>
			Of magical illusions knew the game.</p>
			<p>Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,<br/>
			Who now unto his leather and his thread<br/>
			Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.</p>
			<p>Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,<br/>
			The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;<br/>
			They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.</p>
			<p>But come now, for already holds the confines<br/>
			Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville<br/>
			Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,</p>
			<p>And yesternight the moon was round already;<br/>
			Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee<br/>
			From time to time within the forest deep."</p>
			<p>Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things<br/>
			Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,<br/>
			We came along, and held the summit, when</p>
			<p>We halted to behold another fissure<br/>
			Of Malebolge and other vain laments;<br/>
			And I beheld it marvellously dark.</p>
			<p>As in the Arsenal of the Venetians<br/>
			Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch<br/>
			To smear their unsound vessels o'er again,</p>
			<p>For sail they cannot; and instead thereof<br/>
			One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks<br/>
			The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;</p>
			<p>One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,<br/>
			This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,<br/>
			Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;</p>
			<p>Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,<br/>
			Was boiling down below there a dense pitch<br/>
			Which upon every side the bank belimed.</p>
			<p>I saw it, but I did not see within it<br/>
			Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,<br/>
			And all swell up and resubside compressed.</p>
			<p>The while below there fixedly I gazed,<br/>
			My Leader, crying out: "Beware, beware!"<br/>
			Drew me unto himself from where I stood.</p>
			<p>Then I turned round, as one who is impatient<br/>
			To see what it behoves him to escape,<br/>
			And whom a sudden terror doth unman,</p>
			<p>Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;<br/>
			And I beheld behind us a black devil,<br/>
			Running along upon the crag, approach.</p>
			<p>Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!<br/>
			And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,<br/>
			With open wings and light upon his feet!</p>
			<p>His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,<br/>
			A sinner did encumber with both haunches,<br/>
			And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.</p>
			<p>From off our bridge, he said: "O Malebranche,<br/>
			Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;<br/>
			Plunge him beneath, for I return for others</p>
			<p>Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.<br/>
			All there are barrators, except Bonturo;<br/>
			No into Yes for money there is changed."</p>
			<p>He hurled him down, and over the hard crag<br/>
			Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened<br/>
			In so much hurry to pursue a thief.</p>
			<p>The other sank, and rose again face downward;<br/>
			But the demons, under cover of the bridge,<br/>
			Cried: "Here the Santo Volto has no place!</p>
			<p>Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;<br/>
			Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,<br/>
			Do not uplift thyself above the pitch."</p>
			<p>They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;<br/>
			They said: "It here behoves thee to dance covered,<br/>
			That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer."</p>
			<p>Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make<br/>
			Immerse into the middle of the caldron<br/>
			The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.</p>
			<p>Said the good Master to me: "That it be not<br/>
			Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down<br/>
			Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;</p>
			<p>And for no outrage that is done to me<br/>
			Be thou afraid, because these things I know,<br/>
			For once before was I in such a scuffle."</p>
			<p>Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head,<br/>
			And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,<br/>
			Need was for him to have a steadfast front.</p>
			<p>With the same fury, and the same uproar,<br/>
			As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,<br/>
			Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops,</p>
			<p>They issued from beneath the little bridge,<br/>
			And turned against him all their grappling-irons;<br/>
			But he cried out: "Be none of you malignant!</p>
			<p>Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,<br/>
			Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,<br/>
			And then take counsel as to grappling me."</p>
			<p>They all cried out: "Let Malacoda go;"<br/>
			Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,<br/>
			And he came to him, saying: "What avails it?"</p>
			<p>"Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me<br/>
			Advanced into this place," my Master said,<br/>
			"Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,</p>
			<p>Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?<br/>
			Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed<br/>
			That I another show this savage road."</p>
			<p>Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,<br/>
			That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,<br/>
			And to the others said: "Now strike him not."</p>
			<p>And unto me my Guide: "O thou, who sittest<br/>
			Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,<br/>
			Securely now return to me again."</p>
			<p>Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;<br/>
			And all the devils forward thrust themselves,<br/>
			So that I feared they would not keep their compact.</p>
			<p>And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers<br/>
			Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,<br/>
			Seeing themselves among so many foes.</p>
			<p>Close did I press myself with all my person<br/>
			Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes<br/>
			From off their countenance, which was not good.</p>
			<p>They lowered their rakes, and "Wilt thou have me hit him,"<br/>
			They said to one another, "on the rump?"<br/>
			And answered: "Yes; see that thou nick him with it."</p>
			<p>But the same demon who was holding parley<br/>
			With my Conductor turned him very quickly,<br/>
			And said: "Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;"</p>
			<p>Then said to us: "You can no farther go<br/>
			Forward upon this crag, because is lying<br/>
			All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.</p>
			<p>And if it still doth please you to go onward,<br/>
			Pursue your way along upon this rock;<br/>
			Near is another crag that yields a path.</p>
			<p>Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,<br/>
			One thousand and two hundred sixty-six<br/>
			Years were complete, that here the way was broken.</p>
			<p>I send in that direction some of mine<br/>
			To see if any one doth air himself;<br/>
			Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.</p>
			<p>Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,"<br/>
			Began he to cry out, "and thou, Cagnazzo;<br/>
			And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.</p>
			<p>Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,<br/>
			And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,<br/>
			And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;</p>
			<p>Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;<br/>
			Let these be safe as far as the next crag,<br/>
			That all unbroken passes o'er the dens."</p>
			<p>"O me! what is it, Master, that I see?<br/>
			Pray let us go," I said, "without an escort,<br/>
			If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.</p>
			<p>If thou art as observant as thy wont is,<br/>
			Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,<br/>
			And with their brows are threatening woe to us?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "I will not have thee fear;<br/>
			Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,<br/>
			Because they do it for those boiling wretches."</p>
			<p>Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;<br/>
			But first had each one thrust his tongue between<br/>
			His teeth towards their leader for a signal;</p>
			<p>And he had made a trumpet of his rump.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,<br/>
			Begin the storming, and their muster make,<br/>
			And sometimes starting off for their escape;</p>
			<p>Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,<br/>

			Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,</p>
			<p>Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,<br/>
			With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,<br/>
			And with our own, and with outlandish things,</p>
			<p>But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth<br/>
			Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,<br/>
			Nor ship by any sign of land or star.</p>
			<p>We went upon our way with the ten demons;<br/>
			Ah, savage company! but in the church<br/>
			With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!</p>
			<p>Ever upon the pitch was my intent,<br/>
			To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,<br/>
			And of the people who therein were burned.</p>
			<p>Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign<br/>
			To mariners by arching of the back,<br/>
			That they should counsel take to save their vessel,</p>
			<p>Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,<br/>

			<p>As on the brink of water in a ditch<br/>

			<p>I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,<br/>
			One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass<br/>
			One frog remains, and down another dives;</p>
			<p>And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,<br/>
			Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,<br/>
			And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.</p>
			<p>I knew, before, the names of all of them,<br/>
			So had I noted them when they were chosen,<br/>
			And when they called each other, listened how.</p>
			<p>"O Rubicante, see that thou do lay<br/>
			Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,"<br/>
			Cried all together the accursed ones.</p>
			<p>And I: "My Master, see to it, if thou canst,<br/>
			That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,<br/>
			Thus come into his adversaries' hands."</p>
			<p>Near to the side of him my Leader drew,<br/>
			Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:<br/>
			"I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;</p>
			<p>My mother placed me servant to a lord,<br/>
			For she had borne me to a ribald knave,<br/>
			Destroyer of himself and of his things.</p>
			<p>Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;<br/>
			I set me there to practise barratry,<br/>
			For which I pay the reckoning in this heat."</p>
			<p>And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,<br/>
			On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,<br/>
			Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.</p>
			<p>Among malicious cats the mouse had come;<br/>
			But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,<br/>
			And said: "Stand ye aside, while I enfork him."</p>
			<p>And to my Master he turned round his head;<br/>
			"Ask him again," he said, "if more thou wish<br/>
			To know from him, before some one destroy him."</p>
			<p>The Guide: "Now tell then of the other culprits;<br/>
			Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,<br/>
			Under the pitch?"  And he: "I separated</p>
			<p>Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;<br/>
			Would that I still were covered up with him,<br/>
			For I should fear not either claw nor hook!"</p>
			<p>And Libicocco: "We have borne too much;"<br/>
			And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,<br/>
			So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.</p>
			<p>Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him<br/>
			Down at the legs; whence their Decurion<br/>
			Turned round and round about with evil look.</p>
			<p>When they again somewhat were pacified,<br/>
			Of him, who still was looking at his wound,<br/>
			Demanded my Conductor without stay:</p>
			<p>"Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting<br/>
			Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?"<br/>
			And he replied: "It was the Friar Gomita,</p>
			<p>He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,<br/>
			Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,<br/>
			And dealt so with them each exults thereat;</p>
			<p>Money he took, and let them smoothly off,<br/>
			As he says; and in other offices<br/>
			A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.</p>
			<p>Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche<br/>
			Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia<br/>
			To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.</p>
			<p>O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;<br/>
			Still farther would I speak, but am afraid<br/>
			Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready."</p>
			<p>And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,<br/>
			Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,<br/>
			Said: "Stand aside there, thou malicious bird."</p>
			<p>"If you desire either to see or hear,"<br/>
			The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,<br/>
			"Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.</p>
			<p>But let the Malebranche cease a little,<br/>
			So that these may not their revenges fear,<br/>
			And I, down sitting in this very place,</p>
			<p>For one that I am will make seven come,<br/>
			When I shall whistle, as our custom is<br/>
			To do whenever one of us comes out."</p>
			<p>Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,<br/>
			Shaking his head, and said: "Just hear the trick<br/>
			Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!"</p>
			<p>Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,<br/>
			Responded: "I by far too cunning am,<br/>
			When I procure for mine a greater sadness."</p>
			<p>Alichin held not in, but running counter<br/>
			Unto the rest, said to him: "If thou dive,<br/>
			I will not follow thee upon the gallop,</p>
			<p>But I will beat my wings above the pitch;<br/>
			The height be left, and be the bank a shield<br/>
			To see if thou alone dost countervail us."</p>
			<p>O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!<br/>
			Each to the other side his eyes averted;<br/>
			He first, who most reluctant was to do it.</p>
			<p>The Navarrese selected well his time;<br/>
			Planted his feet on land, and in a moment<br/>
			Leaped, and released himself from their design.</p>
			<p>Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,<br/>
			But he most who was cause of the defeat;<br/>
			Therefore he moved, and cried: "Thou art o'ertakern."</p>
			<p>But little it availed, for wings could not<br/>
			Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,<br/>
			And, flying, upward he his breast directed;</p>
			<p>Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden<br/>
			Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,<br/>
			And upward he returneth cross and weary.</p>
			<p>Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina<br/>
			Flying behind him followed close, desirous<br/>

			<p>And when the barrator had disappeared,<br/>
			He turned his talons upon his companion,<br/>
			And grappled with him right above the moat.</p>
			<p>But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk<br/>
			To clapperclaw him well; and both of them<br/>
			Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.</p>
			<p>A sudden intercessor was the heat;<br/>
			But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught,<br/>
			To such degree they had their wings belimed.</p>
			<p>Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia<br/>
			Made four of them fly to the other side<br/>
			With all their gaffs, and very speedily</p>
			<p>This side and that they to their posts descended;<br/>
			They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,<br/>
			Who were already baked within the crust,</p>
			<p>And in this manner busied did we leave them.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Silent, alone, and without company<br/>
			We went, the one in front, the other after,<br/>
			As go the Minor Friars along their way.</p>
			<p>Upon the fable of Aesop was directed<br/>
			My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,<br/>
			Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;</p>
			<p>For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike<br/>
			Than this one is to that, if well we couple<br/>
			End and beginning with a steadfast mind.</p>
			<p>And even as one thought from another springs,<br/>
			So afterward from that was born another,<br/>
			Which the first fear within me double made.</p>
			<p>Thus did I ponder: "These on our account<br/>
			Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff<br/>
			So great, that much I think it must annoy them.</p>
			<p>If anger be engrafted on ill-will,<br/>
			They will come after us more merciless<br/>
			Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,"</p>
			<p>I felt my hair stand all on end already<br/>
			With terror, and stood backwardly intent,<br/>
			When said I: "Master, if thou hidest not</p>
			<p>Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche<br/>
			I am in dread; we have them now behind us;<br/>
			I so imagine them, I already feel them."</p>
			<p>And he: "If I were made of leaded glass,<br/>
			Thine outward image I should not attract<br/>
			Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.</p>
			<p>Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,<br/>
			With similar attitude and similar face,<br/>
			So that of both one counsel sole I made.</p>
			<p>If peradventure the right bank so slope<br/>
			That we to the next Bolgia can descend,<br/>
			We shall escape from the imagined chase."</p>
			<p>Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,<br/>
			When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,<br/>
			Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.</p>
			<p>My Leader on a sudden seized me up,<br/>
			Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,<br/>
			And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,</p>
			<p>Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,<br/>
			Having more care of him than of herself,<br/>
			So that she clothes her only with a shift;</p>
			<p>And downward from the top of the hard bank<br/>
			Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,<br/>
			That one side of the other Bolgia walls.</p>
			<p>Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice<br/>
			To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,<br/>
			When nearest to the paddles it approaches,</p>
			<p>As did my Master down along that border,<br/>
			Bearing me with him on his breast away,<br/>
			As his own son, and not as a companion.</p>
			<p>Hardly the bed of the ravine below<br/>
			His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill<br/>
			Right over us; but he was not afraid;</p>
			<p>For the high Providence, which had ordained<br/>
			To place them ministers of the fifth moat,<br/>
			The power of thence departing took from all.</p>
			<p>A painted people there below we found,<br/>
			Who went about with footsteps very slow,<br/>
			Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.</p>
			<p>They had on mantles with the hoods low down<br/>
			Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut<br/>
			That in Cologne they for the monks are made.</p>
			<p>Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;<br/>
			But inwardly all leaden and so heavy<br/>
			That Frederick used to put them on of straw.</p>
			<p>O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!<br/>
			Again we turned us, still to the left hand<br/>
			Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;</p>
			<p>But owing to the weight, that weary folk<br/>
			Came on so tardily, that we were new<br/>
			In company at each motion of the haunch.</p>
			<p>Whence I unto my Leader: "See thou find<br/>
			Some one who may by deed or name be known,<br/>
			And thus in going move thine eye about."</p>
			<p>And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,<br/>
			Cried to us from behind: "Stay ye your feet,<br/>
			Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!</p>
			<p>Perhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest."<br/>
			Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: "Wait,<br/>
			And then according to his pace proceed."</p>
			<p>I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste<br/>
			Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;<br/>
			But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.</p>
			<p>When they came up, long with an eye askance<br/>
			They scanned me without uttering a word.<br/>
			Then to each other turned, and said together:</p>
			<p>"He by the action of his throat seems living;<br/>
			And if they dead are, by what privilege<br/>
			Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?"</p>
			<p>Then said to me: "Tuscan, who to the college<br/>
			Of miserable hypocrites art come,<br/>
			Do not disdain to tell us who thou art."</p>
			<p>And I to them: "Born was I, and grew up<br/>
			In the great town on the fair river of Arno,<br/>
			And with the body am I've always had.</p>
			<p>But who are ye, in whom there trickles down<br/>
			Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?<br/>
			And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?"</p>
			<p>And one replied to me: "These orange cloaks<br/>
			Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights<br/>
			Cause in this way their balances to creak.</p>
			<p>Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;<br/>
			I Catalano, and he Loderingo<br/>
			Named, and together taken by thy city,</p>
			<p>As the wont is to take one man alone,<br/>
			For maintenance of its peace; and we were such<br/>
			That still it is apparent round Gardingo."</p>
			<p>"O Friars," began I, "your iniquitous. . ."<br/>
			But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed<br/>
			One crucified with three stakes on the ground.</p>
			<p>When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,<br/>
			Blowing into his beard with suspirations;<br/>
			And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,</p>
			<p>Said to me: "This transfixed one, whom thou seest,<br/>
			Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet<br/>
			To put one man to torture for the people.</p>
			<p>Crosswise and naked is he on the path,<br/>
			As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,<br/>
			Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;</p>
			<p>And in like mode his father-in-law is punished<br/>
			Within this moat, and the others of the council,<br/>
			Which for the Jews was a malignant seed."</p>
			<p>And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel<br/>
			O'er him who was extended on the cross<br/>
			So vilely in eternal banishment.</p>
			<p>Then he directed to the Friar this voice:<br/>
			"Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us<br/>
			If to the right hand any pass slope down</p>
			<p>By which we two may issue forth from here,<br/>
			Without constraining some of the black angels<br/>
			To come and extricate us from this deep."</p>
			<p>Then he made answer: "Nearer than thou hopest<br/>
			There is a rock, that forth from the great circle<br/>
			Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,</p>
			<p>Save that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it;<br/>
			You will be able to mount up the ruin,<br/>
			That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises."</p>
			<p>The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;<br/>
			Then said: "The business badly he recounted<br/>
			Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder."</p>
			<p>And the Friar: "Many of the Devil's vices<br/>
			Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,<br/>
			That he's a liar and the father of lies."</p>
			<p>Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,<br/>
			Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;<br/>
			Whence from the heavy-laden I departed</p>
			<p>After the prints of his beloved feet.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXIV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">In that part of the youthful year wherein<br/>
			The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,<br/>
			And now the nights draw near to half the day,</p>
			<p>What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground<br/>
			The outward semblance of her sister white,<br/>
			But little lasts the temper of her pen,</p>
			<p>The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,<br/>
			Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign<br/>
			All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,</p>
			<p>Returns in doors, and up and down laments,<br/>
			Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;<br/>
			Then he returns and hope revives again,</p>
			<p>Seeing the world has changed its countenance<br/>
			In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,<br/>
			And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.</p>
			<p>Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,<br/>
			When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,<br/>
			And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.</p>
			<p>For as we came unto the ruined bridge,<br/>
			The Leader turned to me with that sweet look<br/>
			Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld.</p>
			<p>His arms he opened, after some advisement<br/>
			Within himself elected, looking first<br/>
			Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.</p>
			<p>And even as he who acts and meditates,<br/>
			For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,<br/>
			So upward lifting me towards the summit</p>
			<p>Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,<br/>
			Saying: "To that one grapple afterwards,<br/>
			But try first if 'tis such that it will hold thee."</p>
			<p>This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;<br/>
			For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,<br/>
			Were able to ascend from jag to jag.</p>
			<p>And had it not been, that upon that precinct<br/>
			Shorter was the ascent than on the other,<br/>
			He I know not, but I had been dead beat.</p>
			<p>But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth<br/>
			Of the profoundest well is all inclining,<br/>
			The structure of each valley doth import</p>
			<p>That one bank rises and the other sinks.<br/>
			Still we arrived at length upon the point<br/>
			Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.</p>
			<p>The breath was from my lungs so milked away,<br/>
			When I was up, that I could go no farther,<br/>
			Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.</p>
			<p>"Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,"<br/>
			My Master said; "for sitting upon down,<br/>
			Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,</p>
			<p>Withouten which whoso his life consumes<br/>
			Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,<br/>
			As smoke in air or in the water foam.</p>
			<p>And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish<br/>
			With spirit that o'ercometh every battle,<br/>
			If with its heavy body it sink not.</p>
			<p>A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;<br/>
			'Tis not enough from these to have departed;<br/>
			Let it avail thee, if thou understand me."</p>
			<p>Then I uprose, showing myself provided<br/>
			Better with breath than I did feel myself,<br/>
			And said: "Go on, for I am strong and bold."</p>
			<p>Upward we took our way along the crag,<br/>
			Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,<br/>
			And more precipitous far than that before.</p>
			<p>Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;<br/>
			Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,<br/>
			Not well adapted to articulate words.</p>
			<p>I know not what it said, though o'er the back<br/>
			I now was of the arch that passes there;<br/>
			But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.</p>
			<p>I was bent downward, but my living eyes<br/>
			Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;<br/>
			Wherefore I: "Master, see that thou arrive</p>
			<p>At the next round, and let us descend the wall;<br/>
			For as from hence I hear and understand not,<br/>
			So I look down and nothing I distinguish."</p>
			<p>"Other response," he said, "I make thee not,<br/>
			Except the doing; for the modest asking<br/>
			Ought to be followed by the deed in silence."</p>
			<p>We from the bridge descended at its head,<br/>
			Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,<br/>
			And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;</p>
			<p>And I beheld therein a terrible throng<br/>
			Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,<br/>
			That the remembrance still congeals my blood</p>
			<p>Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;<br/>
			For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae<br/>
			She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,</p>
			<p>Neither so many plagues nor so malignant<br/>
			E'er showed she with all Ethiopia,<br/>
			Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!</p>
			<p>Among this cruel and most dismal throng<br/>
			People were running naked and affrighted.<br/>
			Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.</p>
			<p>They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;<br/>
			These riveted upon their reins the tail<br/>
			And head, and were in front of them entwined.</p>
			<p>And lo! at one who was upon our side<br/>
			There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him<br/>
			There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.</p>
			<p>Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,<br/>
			As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly<br/>
			Behoved it that in falling he became.</p>
			<p>And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,<br/>
			The ashes drew together, and of themselves<br/>
			Into himself they instantly returned.</p>
			<p>Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed<br/>
			The phoenix dies, and then is born again,<br/>
			When it approaches its five-hundredth year;</p>
			<p>On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,<br/>
			But only on tears of incense and amomum,<br/>
			And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.</p>
			<p>And as he is who falls, and knows not how,<br/>
			By force of demons who to earth down drag him,<br/>
			Or other oppilation that binds man,</p>
			<p>When he arises and around him looks,<br/>
			Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish<br/>
			Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;</p>
			<p>Such was that sinner after he had risen.<br/>
			Justice of God! O how severe it is,<br/>
			That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!</p>
			<p>The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;<br/>
			Whence he replied: "I rained from Tuscany<br/>
			A short time since into this cruel gorge.</p>
			<p>A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,<br/>
			Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci,<br/>
			Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den."</p>
			<p>And I unto the Guide: "Tell him to stir not,<br/>
			And ask what crime has thrust him here below,<br/>
			For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him."</p>
			<p>And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,<br/>
			But unto me directed mind and face,<br/>
			And with a melancholy shame was painted.</p>
			<p>Then said: "It pains me more that thou hast caught me<br/>
			Amid this misery where thou seest me,<br/>
			Than when I from the other life was taken.</p>
			<p>What thou demandest I cannot deny;<br/>
			So low am I put down because I robbed<br/>
			The sacristy of the fair ornaments,</p>
			<p>And falsely once 'twas laid upon another;<br/>
			But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,<br/>
			If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places,</p>
			<p>Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:<br/>
			Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;<br/>
			Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;</p>
			<p>Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,<br/>
			Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,<br/>
			And with impetuous and bitter tempest</p>
			<p>Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;<br/>
			When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,<br/>
			So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.</p>
			<p>And this I've said that it may give thee pain."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">At the conclusion of his words, the thief<br/>
			Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,<br/>
			Crying: "Take that, God, for at thee I aim them."</p>
			<p>From that time forth the serpents were my friends;<br/>
			For one entwined itself about his neck<br/>
			As if it said: "I will not thou speak more;"</p>
			<p>And round his arms another, and rebound him,<br/>
			Clinching itself together so in front,<br/>
			That with them he could not a motion make.</p>
			<p>Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not<br/>
			To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,<br/>
			Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?</p>
			<p>Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,<br/>
			Spirit I saw not against God so proud,<br/>
			Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!</p>
			<p>He fled away, and spake no further word;<br/>
			And I beheld a Centaur full of rage<br/>
			Come crying out: "Where is, where is the scoffer?"</p>
			<p>I do not think Maremma has so many<br/>
			Serpents as he had all along his back,<br/>
			As far as where our countenance begins.</p>
			<p>Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,<br/>
			With wings wide open was a dragon lying,<br/>
			And he sets fire to all that he encounters.</p>
			<p>My Master said: "That one is Cacus, who<br/>
			Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine<br/>
			Created oftentimes a lake of blood.</p>
			<p>He goes not on the same road with his brothers,<br/>
			By reason of the fraudulent theft he made<br/>
			Of the great herd, which he had near to him;</p>
			<p>Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath<br/>
			The mace of Hercules, who peradventure<br/>
			Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten."</p>
			<p>While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,<br/>
			And spirits three had underneath us come,<br/>
			Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,</p>
			<p>Until what time they shouted: "Who are you?"<br/>
			On which account our story made a halt,<br/>
			And then we were intent on them alone.</p>
			<p>I did not know them; but it came to pass,<br/>
			As it is wont to happen by some chance,<br/>
			That one to name the other was compelled,</p>
			<p>Exclaiming: "Where can Cianfa have remained?"<br/>
			Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,<br/>
			Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.</p>
			<p>If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe<br/>
			What I shall say, it will no marvel be,<br/>
			For I who saw it hardly can admit it.</p>
			<p>As I was holding raised on them my brows,<br/>
			Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth<br/>
			In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.</p>
			<p>With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,<br/>
			And with the forward ones his arms it seized;<br/>
			Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;</p>
			<p>The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,<br/>
			And put its tail through in between the two,<br/>
			And up behind along the reins outspread it.</p>
			<p>Ivy was never fastened by its barbs<br/>
			Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile<br/>
			Upon the other's limbs entwined its own.</p>
			<p>Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax<br/>
			They had been made, and intermixed their colour;<br/>
			Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;</p>
			<p>E'en as proceedeth on before the flame<br/>
			Upward along the paper a brown colour,<br/>
			Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.</p>
			<p>The other two looked on, and each of them<br/>
			Cried out: "O me, Agnello, how thou changest!<br/>
			Behold, thou now art neither two nor one."</p>
			<p>Already the two heads had one become,<br/>
			When there appeared to us two figures mingled<br/>
			Into one face, wherein the two were lost.</p>
			<p>Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,<br/>
			The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest<br/>
			Members became that never yet were seen.</p>
			<p>Every original aspect there was cancelled;<br/>
			Two and yet none did the perverted image<br/>
			Appear, and such departed with slow pace.</p>
			<p>Even as a lizard, under the great scourge<br/>
			Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,<br/>
			Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;</p>
			<p>Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies<br/>
			Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,<br/>
			Livid and black as is a peppercorn.</p>
			<p>And in that part whereat is first received<br/>
			Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;<br/>
			Then downward fell in front of him extended.</p>
			<p>The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;<br/>
			Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,<br/>
			Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.</p>
			<p>He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;<br/>
			One through the wound, the other through the mouth<br/>
			Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.</p>
			<p>Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions<br/>
			Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,<br/>
			And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.</p>
			<p>Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;<br/>
			For if him to a snake, her to fountain,<br/>
			Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;</p>
			<p>Because two natures never front to front<br/>
			Has he transmuted, so that both the forms<br/>
			To interchange their matter ready were.</p>
			<p>Together they responded in such wise,<br/>
			That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,<br/>
			And eke the wounded drew his feet together.</p>
			<p>The legs together with the thighs themselves<br/>
			Adhered so, that in little time the juncture<br/>
			No sign whatever made that was apparent.</p>
			<p>He with the cloven tail assumed the figure<br/>
			The other one was losing, and his skin<br/>
			Became elastic, and the other's hard.</p>
			<p>I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,<br/>
			And both feet of the reptile, that were short,<br/>
			Lengthen as much as those contracted were.</p>
			<p>Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,<br/>
			Became the member that a man conceals,<br/>
			And of his own the wretch had two created.</p>
			<p>While both of them the exhalation veils<br/>
			With a new colour, and engenders hair<br/>
			On one of them and depilates the other,</p>
			<p>The one uprose and down the other fell,<br/>
			Though turning not away their impious lamps,<br/>
			Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.</p>
			<p>He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,<br/>
			And from excess of matter, which came thither,<br/>
			Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;</p>
			<p>What did not backward run and was retained<br/>
			Of that excess made to the face a nose,<br/>
			And the lips thickened far as was befitting.</p>
			<p>He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,<br/>
			And backward draws the ears into his head,<br/>
			In the same manner as the snail its horns;</p>
			<p>And so the tongue, which was entire and apt<br/>
			For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked<br/>
			In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.</p>
			<p>The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,<br/>
			Along the valley hissing takes to flight,<br/>
			And after him the other speaking sputters.</p>
			<p>Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,<br/>
			And said to the other: "I'll have Buoso run,<br/>
			Crawling as I have done, along this road."</p>
			<p>In this way I beheld the seventh ballast<br/>
			Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse<br/>
			The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.</p>
			<p>And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be<br/>
			Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,<br/>
			They could not flee away so secretly</p>
			<p>But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;<br/>
			And he it was who sole of three companions,<br/>
			Which came in the beginning, was not changed;</p>
			<p>The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.</p>

			<p>With flames as manifold resplendent all<br/>
			Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware<br/>
			As soon as I was where the depth appeared.</p>
			<p>And such as he who with the bears avenged him<br/>
			Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,<br/>
			What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,</p>
			<p>For with his eye he could not follow it<br/>
			So as to see aught else than flame alone,<br/>
			Even as a little cloud ascending upward,</p>
			<p>Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment<br/>
			Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,<br/>
			And every flame a sinner steals away.</p>
			<p>I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,<br/>
			So that, if I had seized not on a rock,<br/>
			Down had I fallen without being pushed.</p>
			<p>And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,<br/>
			Exclaimed: "Within the fires the spirits are;<br/>
			Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns."</p>
			<p>"My Master," I replied, "by hearing thee<br/>
			I am more sure; but I surmised already<br/>
			It might be so, and already wished to ask thee</p>
			<p>Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft<br/>
			At top, it seems uprising from the pyre<br/>
			Where was Eteocles with his brother placed."</p>
			<p>He answered me: "Within there are tormented<br/>
			Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together<br/>
			They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.</p>
			<p>And there within their flame do they lament<br/>
			The ambush of the horse, which made the door<br/>
			Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed;</p>
			<p>Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead<br/>
			Deidamia still deplores Achilles,<br/>
			And pain for the Palladium there is borne."</p>
			<p>"If they within those sparks possess the power<br/>
			To speak," I said, "thee, Master, much I pray,<br/>
			And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,</p>
			<p>That thou make no denial of awaiting<br/>
			Until the horned flame shall hither come;<br/>
			Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Worthy is thy entreaty<br/>
			Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;<br/>
			But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.</p>
			<p>Leave me to speak, because I have conceived<br/>
			That which thou wishest; for they might disdain<br/>
			Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine."</p>
			<p>When now the flame had come unto that point,<br/>
			Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,<br/>
			After this fashion did I hear him speak:</p>
			<p>"O ye, who are twofold within one fire,<br/>
			If I deserved of you, while I was living,<br/>
			If I deserved of you or much or little</p>
			<p>When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,<br/>
			Do not move on, but one of you declare<br/>
			Whither, being lost, he went away to die."</p>
			<p>Then of the antique flame the greater horn,<br/>
			Murmuring, began to wave itself about<br/>
			Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.</p>
			<p>Thereafterward, the summit to and fro<br/>
			Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,<br/>
			It uttered forth a voice, and said: "When I</p>
			<p>From Circe had departed, who concealed me<br/>
			More than a year there near unto Gaeta,<br/>
			Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,</p>
			<p>Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence<br/>
			For my old father, nor the due affection<br/>
			Which joyous should have made Penelope,</p>
			<p>Could overcome within me the desire<br/>
			I had to be experienced of the world,<br/>
			And of the vice and virtue of mankind;</p>
			<p>But I put forth on the high open sea<br/>
			With one sole ship, and that small company<br/>
			By which I never had deserted been.</p>
			<p>Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,<br/>
			Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,<br/>
			And the others which that sea bathes round about.</p>
			<p>I and my company were old and slow<br/>
			When at that narrow passage we arrived<br/>
			Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,</p>
			<p>That man no farther onward should adventure.<br/>
			On the right hand behind me left I Seville,<br/>
			And on the other already had left Ceuta.</p>
			<p>'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand<br/>
			Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,<br/>
			To this so inconsiderable vigil</p>
			<p>Which is remaining of your senses still<br/>
			Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,<br/>
			Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.</p>
			<p>Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;<br/>
			Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,<br/>
			But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'</p>
			<p>So eager did I render my companions,<br/>
			With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,<br/>
			That then I hardly could have held them back.</p>
			<p>And having turned our stern unto the morning,<br/>
			We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,<br/>
			Evermore gaining on the larboard side.</p>
			<p>Already all the stars of the other pole<br/>
			The night beheld, and ours so very low<br/>
			It did not rise above the ocean floor.</p>
			<p>Five times rekindled and as many quenched<br/>
			Had been the splendour underneath the moon,<br/>
			Since we had entered into the deep pass,</p>
			<p>When there appeared to us a mountain, dim<br/>
			From distance, and it seemed to me so high<br/>
			As I had never any one beheld.</p>
			<p>Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;<br/>
			For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,<br/>
			And smote upon the fore part of the ship.</p>
			<p>Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,<br/>
			At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,<br/>
			And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,</p>
			<p>Until the sea above us closed again."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXVII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Already was the flame erect and quiet,<br/>
			To speak no more, and now departed from us<br/>
			With the permission of the gentle Poet;</p>
			<p>When yet another, which behind it came,<br/>
			Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top<br/>
			By a confused sound that issued from it.</p>
			<p>As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first<br/>
			With the lament of him, and that was right,<br/>
			Who with his file had modulated it)</p>
			<p>Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,<br/>
			That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,<br/>
			Still it appeared with agony transfixed;</p>
			<p>Thus, by not having any way or issue<br/>
			At first from out the fire, to its own language<br/>
			Converted were the melancholy words.</p>
			<p>But afterwards, when they had gathered way<br/>
			Up through the point, giving it that vibration<br/>
			The tongue had given them in their passage out,</p>
			<p>We heard it said: "O thou, at whom I aim<br/>
			My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,<br/>
			Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'</p>
			<p>Because I come perchance a little late,<br/>
			To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;<br/>
			Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.</p>
			<p>If thou but lately into this blind world<br/>
			Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,<br/>
			Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,</p>
			<p>Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,<br/>
			For I was from the mountains there between<br/>
			Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts."</p>
			<p>I still was downward bent and listening,<br/>
			When my Conductor touched me on the side,<br/>
			Saying: "Speak thou: this one a Latian is."</p>
			<p>And I, who had beforehand my reply<br/>
			In readiness, forthwith began to speak:<br/>
			"O soul, that down below there art concealed,</p>
			<p>Romagna thine is not and never has been<br/>
			Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;<br/>
			But open war I none have left there now.</p>
			<p>Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;<br/>
			The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,<br/>
			So that she covers Cervia with her vans.</p>
			<p>The city which once made the long resistance,<br/>
			And of the French a sanguinary heap,<br/>
			Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;</p>
			<p>Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new,<br/>
			Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,<br/>
			Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.</p>
			<p>The cities of Lamone and Santerno<br/>
			Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,<br/>
			Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter;</p>
			<p>And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,<br/>
			Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,<br/>
			Lives between tyranny and a free state.</p>
			<p>Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;<br/>
			Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,<br/>
			So may thy name hold front there in the world."</p>
			<p>After the fire a little more had roared<br/>
			In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved<br/>
			This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:</p>
			<p>"If I believed that my reply were made<br/>
			To one who to the world would e'er return,<br/>
			This flame without more flickering would stand still;</p>
			<p>But inasmuch as never from this depth<br/>
			Did any one return, if I hear true,<br/>
			Without the fear of infamy I answer,</p>
			<p>I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,<br/>
			Believing thus begirt to make amends;<br/>
			And truly my belief had been fulfilled</p>
			<p>But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,<br/>
			Who put me back into my former sins;<br/>
			And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.</p>
			<p>While I was still the form of bone and pulp<br/>
			My mother gave to me, the deeds I did<br/>
			Were not those of a lion, but a fox.</p>
			<p>The machinations and the covert ways<br/>
			I knew them all, and practised so their craft,<br/>
			That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.</p>
			<p>When now unto that portion of mine age<br/>
			I saw myself arrived, when each one ought<br/>
			To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,</p>
			<p>That which before had pleased me then displeased me;<br/>
			And penitent and confessing I surrendered,<br/>
			Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;</p>
			<p>The Leader of the modern Pharisees<br/>
			Having a war near unto Lateran,<br/>
			And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,</p>
			<p>For each one of his enemies was Christian,<br/>
			And none of them had been to conquer Acre,<br/>
			Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land,</p>
			<p>Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,<br/>
			In him regarded, nor in me that cord<br/>
			Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;</p>
			<p>But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester<br/>
			To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,<br/>
			So this one sought me out as an adept</p>
			<p>To cure him of the fever of his pride.<br/>
			Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,<br/>
			Because his words appeared inebriate.</p>
			<p>And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid;<br/>
			Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me<br/>
			How to raze Palestrina to the ground.</p>
			<p>Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,<br/>
			As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,<br/>
			The which my predecessor held not dear.'</p>
			<p>Then urged me on his weighty arguments<br/>
			There, where my silence was the worst advice;<br/>
			And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me</p>
			<p>Of that sin into which I now must fall,<br/>
			The promise long with the fulfilment short<br/>
			Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.'</p>
			<p>Francis came afterward, when I was dead,<br/>
			For me; but one of the black Cherubim<br/>
			Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong;</p>
			<p>He must come down among my servitors,<br/>
			Because he gave the fraudulent advice<br/>
			From which time forth I have been at his hair;</p>
			<p>For who repents not cannot be absolved,<br/>
			Nor can one both repent and will at once,<br/>
			Because of the contradiction which consents not.'</p>
			<p>O miserable me! how I did shudder<br/>
			When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure<br/>
			Thou didst not think that I was a logician!'</p>
			<p>He bore me unto Minos, who entwined<br/>
			Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,<br/>
			And after he had bitten it in great rage,</p>
			<p>Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'<br/>
			Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,<br/>
			And vested thus in going I bemoan me."</p>
			<p>When it had thus completed its recital,<br/>
			The flame departed uttering lamentations,<br/>
			Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.</p>
			<p>Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,<br/>
			Up o'er the crag above another arch,<br/>
			Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee</p>
			<p>By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXVIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Who ever could, e'en with untrammelled words,<br/>
			Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full<br/>
			Which now I saw, by many times narrating?</p>
			<p>Each tongue would for a certainty fall short<br/>
			By reason of our speech and memory,<br/>
			That have small room to comprehend so much.</p>
			<p>If were again assembled all the people<br/>
			Which formerly upon the fateful land<br/>
			Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood</p>
			<p>Shed by the Romans and the lingering war<br/>
			That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,<br/>
			As Livy has recorded, who errs not,</p>
			<p>With those who felt the agony of blows<br/>
			By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,<br/>
			And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still</p>
			<p>At Ceperano, where a renegade<br/>
			Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo,<br/>
			Where without arms the old Alardo conquered,</p>
			<p>And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,<br/>
			Should show, it would be nothing to compare<br/>
			With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.</p>
			<p>A cask by losing centre-piece or cant<br/>
			Was never shattered so, as I saw one<br/>
			Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.</p>
			<p>Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;<br/>
			His heart was visible, and the dismal sack<br/>
			That maketh excrement of what is eaten.</p>
			<p>While I was all absorbed in seeing him,<br/>
			He looked at me, and opened with his hands<br/>
			His bosom, saying: "See now how I rend me;</p>
			<p>How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;<br/>
			In front of me doth Ali weeping go,<br/>
			Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;</p>
			<p>And all the others whom thou here beholdest,<br/>
			Disseminators of scandal and of schism<br/>
			While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.</p>
			<p>A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us<br/>
			Thus cruelly, unto the falchion's edge<br/>
			Putting again each one of all this ream,</p>
			<p>When we have gone around the doleful road;<br/>
			By reason that our wounds are closed again<br/>
			Ere any one in front of him repass.</p>
			<p>But who art thou, that musest on the crag,<br/>
			Perchance to postpone going to the pain<br/>
			That is adjudged upon thine accusations?"</p>
			<p>"Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,"<br/>
			My Master made reply, "to be tormented;<br/>
			But to procure him full experience,</p>
			<p>Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him<br/>
			Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;<br/>
			And this is true as that I speak to thee."</p>
			<p>More than a hundred were there when they heard him,<br/>
			Who in the moat stood still to look at me,<br/>
			Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.</p>
			<p>"Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,<br/>
			Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,<br/>
			If soon he wish not here to follow me,</p>
			<p>So with provisions, that no stress of snow<br/>
			May give the victory to the Novarese,<br/>
			Which otherwise to gain would not be easy."</p>
			<p>After one foot to go away he lifted,<br/>
			This word did Mahomet say unto me,<br/>
			Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.</p>
			<p>Another one, who had his throat pierced through,<br/>
			And nose cut off close underneath the brows,<br/>
			And had no longer but a single ear,</p>
			<p>Staying to look in wonder with the others,<br/>
			Before the others did his gullet open,<br/>
			Which outwardly was red in every part,</p>
			<p>And said: "O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,<br/>
			And whom I once saw up in Latian land,<br/>
			Unless too great similitude deceive me,</p>
			<p>Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,<br/>
			If e'er thou see again the lovely plain<br/>
			That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,</p>
			<p>And make it known to the best two of Fano,<br/>
			To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,<br/>
			That if foreseeing here be not in vain,</p>
			<p>Cast over from their vessel shall they be,<br/>
			And drowned near unto the Cattolica,<br/>
			By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.</p>
			<p>Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca<br/>
			Neptune ne'er yet beheld so great a crime,<br/>
			Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.</p>
			<p>That traitor, who sees only with one eye,<br/>
			And holds the land, which some one here with me<br/>
			Would fain be fasting from the vision of,</p>
			<p>Will make them come unto a parley with him;<br/>
			Then will do so, that to Focara's wind<br/>
			They will not stand in need of vow or prayer."</p>
			<p>And I to him: "Show to me and declare,<br/>
			If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,<br/>
			Who is this person of the bitter vision."</p>
			<p>Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw<br/>
			Of one of his companions, and his mouth<br/>
			Oped, crying: "This is he, and he speaks not.</p>
			<p>This one, being banished, every doubt submerged<br/>
			In Caesar by affirming the forearmed<br/>
			Always with detriment allowed delay."</p>
			<p>O how bewildered unto me appeared,<br/>
			With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,<br/>
			Curio, who in speaking was so bold!</p>
			<p>And one, who both his hands dissevered had,<br/>
			The stumps uplifting through the murky air,<br/>
			So that the blood made horrible his face,</p>
			<p>Cried out: "Thou shalt remember Mosca also,<br/>
			Who said, alas! 'A thing done has an end!'<br/>
			Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people."</p>
			<p>"And death unto thy race," thereto I added;<br/>
			Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,<br/>
			Departed, like a person sad and crazed.</p>
			<p>But I remained to look upon the crowd;<br/>
			And saw a thing which I should be afraid,<br/>
			Without some further proof, even to recount,</p>
			<p>If it were not that conscience reassures me,<br/>
			That good companion which emboldens man<br/>
			Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.</p>
			<p>I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,<br/>
			A trunk without a head walk in like manner<br/>
			As walked the others of the mournful herd.</p>
			<p>And by the hair it held the head dissevered,<br/>
			Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,<br/>
			And that upon us gazed and said: "O me!"</p>
			<p>It of itself made to itself a lamp,<br/>
			And they were two in one, and one in two;<br/>
			How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.</p>
			<p>When it was come close to the bridge's foot,<br/>
			It lifted high its arm with all the head,<br/>
			To bring more closely unto us its words,</p>
			<p>Which were: "Behold now the sore penalty,<br/>
			Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;<br/>
			Behold if any be as great as this.</p>
			<p>And so that thou may carry news of me,<br/>
			Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same<br/>
			Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.</p>
			<p>I made the father and the son rebellious;<br/>
			Achitophel not more with Absalom<br/>
			And David did with his accursed goadings.</p>
			<p>Because I parted persons so united,<br/>
			Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!<br/>
			From its beginning, which is in this trunk.</p>
			<p>Thus is observed in me the counterpoise."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXIX</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">The many people and the divers wounds<br/>
			These eyes of mine had so inebriated,<br/>
			That they were wishful to stand still and weep;</p>
			<p>But said Virgilius: "What dost thou still gaze at?<br/>
			Why is thy sight still riveted down there<br/>
			Among the mournful, mutilated shades?</p>
			<p>Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;<br/>
			Consider, if to count them thou believest,<br/>
			That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,</p>
			<p>And now the moon is underneath our feet;<br/>
			Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,<br/>
			And more is to be seen than what thou seest."</p>
			<p>"If thou hadst," I made answer thereupon,<br/>
			"Attended to the cause for which I looked,<br/>
			Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned."</p>
			<p>Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him<br/>
			I went, already making my reply,<br/>
			And superadding: "In that cavern where</p>
			<p>I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,<br/>
			I think a spirit of my blood laments<br/>
			The sin which down below there costs so much."</p>
			<p>Then said the Master: "Be no longer broken<br/>
			Thy thought from this time forward upon him;<br/>
			Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;</p>
			<p>For him I saw below the little bridge,<br/>
			Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger<br/>
			Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.</p>
			<p>So wholly at that time wast thou impeded<br/>
			By him who formerly held Altaforte,<br/>
			Thou didst not look that way; so he departed."</p>
			<p>"O my Conductor, his own violent death,<br/>
			Which is not yet avenged for him," I said,<br/>
			"By any who is sharer in the shame,</p>
			<p>Made him disdainful; whence he went away,<br/>
			As I imagine, without speaking to me,<br/>
			And thereby made me pity him the more."</p>
			<p>Thus did we speak as far as the first place<br/>
			Upon the crag, which the next valley shows<br/>
			Down to the bottom, if there were more light.</p>
			<p>When we were now right over the last cloister<br/>
			Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers<br/>
			Could manifest themselves unto our sight,</p>
			<p>Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,<br/>
			Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,<br/>
			Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.</p>
			<p>What pain would be, if from the hospitals<br/>
			Of Valdichiana, 'twixt July and September,<br/>
			And of Maremma and Sardinia</p>
			<p>All the diseases in one moat were gathered,<br/>
			Such was it here, and such a stench came from it<br/>
			As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.</p>
			<p>We had descended on the furthest bank<br/>
			From the long crag, upon the left hand still,<br/>
			And then more vivid was my power of sight</p>
			<p>Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress<br/>
			Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,<br/>
			Punishes forgers, which she here records.</p>
			<p>I do not think a sadder sight to see<br/>
			Was in Aegina the whole people sick,<br/>
			(When was the air so full of pestilence,</p>
			<p>The animals, down to the little worm,<br/>
			All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,<br/>
			According as the poets have affirmed,</p>
			<p>Were from the seed of ants restored again,)<br/>
			Than was it to behold through that dark valley<br/>
			The spirits languishing in divers heaps.</p>
			<p>This on the belly, that upon the back<br/>
			One of the other lay, and others crawling<br/>
			Shifted themselves along the dismal road.</p>
			<p>We step by step went onward without speech,<br/>
			Gazing upon and listening to the sick<br/>
			Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.</p>
			<p>I saw two sitting leaned against each other,<br/>
			As leans in heating platter against platter,<br/>
			From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs;</p>
			<p>And never saw I plied a currycomb<br/>
			By stable-boy for whom his master waits,<br/>
			Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,</p>
			<p>As every one was plying fast the bite<br/>
			Of nails upon himself, for the great rage<br/>
			Of itching which no other succour had.</p>
			<p>And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,<br/>
			In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,<br/>
			Or any other fish that has them largest.</p>
			<p>"O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,"<br/>
			Began my Leader unto one of them,<br/>
			"And makest of them pincers now and then,</p>
			<p>Tell me if any Latian is with those<br/>
			Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee<br/>
			To all eternity unto this work."</p>
			<p>"Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,<br/>
			Both of us here," one weeping made reply;<br/>
			"But who art thou, that questionest about us?"</p>
			<p>And said the Guide: "One am I who descends<br/>
			Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,<br/>
			And I intend to show Hell unto him."</p>
			<p>Then broken was their mutual support,<br/>
			And trembling each one turned himself to me,<br/>
			With others who had heard him by rebound.</p>
			<p>Wholly to me did the good Master gather,<br/>
			Saying: "Say unto them whate'er thou wishest."<br/>
			And I began, since he would have it so:</p>
			<p>"So may your memory not steal away<br/>
			In the first world from out the minds of men,<br/>
			But so may it survive 'neath many suns,</p>
			<p>Say to me who ye are, and of what people;<br/>
			Let not your foul and loathsome punishment<br/>
			Make you afraid to show yourselves to me."</p>
			<p>"I of Arezzo was," one made reply,<br/>
			"And Albert of Siena had me burned;<br/>
			But what I died for does not bring me here.</p>
			<p>'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,<br/>

			Be burned by one who held him as his son.</p>
			<p>But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,<br/>

			<p>And to the Poet said I: "Now was ever<br/>
			So vain a people as the Sienese?<br/>
			Not for a certainty the French by far."</p>
			<p>Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,<br/>
			Replied unto my speech: "Taking out Stricca,<br/>
			Who knew the art of moderate expenses,</p>
			<p>And Niccolo, who the luxurious use<br/>
			Of cloves discovered earliest of all<br/>
			Within that garden where such seed takes root;</p>
			<p>And taking out the band, among whom squandered<br/>
			Caccia d'Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,<br/>
			And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!</p>
			<p>But, that thou know who thus doth second thee<br/>
			Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye<br/>

			<p>And thou shalt see I am Capocchio's shade,<br/>

			Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXX</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">'Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,<br/>
			For Semele, against the Theban blood,<br/>
			As she already more than once had shown,</p>
			<p>So reft of reason Athamas became,<br/>
			That, seeing his own wife with children twain<br/>
			Walking encumbered upon either hand,</p>
			<p>He cried: "Spread out the nets, that I may take<br/>
			The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;"<br/>
			And then extended his unpitying claws,</p>
			<p>Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,<br/>
			And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;<br/>
			And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;—</p>
			<p>And at the time when fortune downward hurled<br/>
			The Trojan's arrogance, that all things dared,<br/>
			So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,</p>
			<p>Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,<br/>
			When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,<br/>
			And of her Polydorus on the shore</p>
			<p>Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,<br/>
			Out of her senses like a dog she barked,<br/>
			So much the anguish had her mind distorted;</p>
			<p>But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan<br/>
			Were ever seen in any one so cruel<br/>
			In goading beasts, and much more human members,</p>
			<p>As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,<br/>
			Who, biting, in the manner ran along<br/>
			That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.</p>
			<p>One to Capocchio came, and by the nape<br/>
			Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging<br/>
			It made his belly grate the solid bottom.</p>
			<p>And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,<br/>
			Said to me: "That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,<br/>
			And raving goes thus harrying other people."</p>
			<p>"O," said I to him, "so may not the other<br/>
			Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee<br/>
			To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "That is the ancient ghost<br/>
			Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became<br/>
			Beyond all rightful love her father's lover.</p>
			<p>She came to sin with him after this manner,<br/>
			By counterfeiting of another's form;<br/>
			As he who goeth yonder undertook,</p>
			<p>That he might gain the lady of the herd,<br/>
			To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,<br/>
			Making a will and giving it due form."</p>
			<p>And after the two maniacs had passed<br/>
			On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back<br/>
			To look upon the other evil-born.</p>
			<p>I saw one made in fashion of a lute,<br/>
			If he had only had the groin cut off<br/>
			Just at the point at which a man is forked.</p>
			<p>The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions<br/>
			The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,<br/>
			That the face corresponds not to the belly,</p>
			<p>Compelled him so to hold his lips apart<br/>
			As does the hectic, who because of thirst<br/>
			One tow'rds the chin, the other upward turns.</p>
			<p>"O ye, who without any torment are,<br/>
			And why I know not, in the world of woe,"<br/>
			He said to us, "behold, and be attentive</p>
			<p>Unto the misery of Master Adam;<br/>
			I had while living much of what I wished,<br/>
			And now, alas! a drop of water crave.</p>
			<p>The rivulets, that from the verdant hills<br/>
			Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,<br/>
			Making their channels to be cold and moist,</p>
			<p>Ever before me stand, and not in vain;<br/>
			For far more doth their image dry me up<br/>
			Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.</p>
			<p>The rigid justice that chastises me<br/>
			Draweth occasion from the place in which<br/>
			I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.</p>
			<p>There is Romena, where I counterfeited<br/>
			The currency imprinted with the Baptist,<br/>
			For which I left my body burned above.</p>
			<p>But if I here could see the tristful soul<br/>
			Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,<br/>
			For Branda's fount I would not give the sight.</p>
			<p>One is within already, if the raving<br/>
			Shades that are going round about speak truth;<br/>
			But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?</p>
			<p>If I were only still so light, that in<br/>
			A hundred years I could advance one inch,<br/>
			I had already started on the way,</p>
			<p>Seeking him out among this squalid folk,<br/>
			Although the circuit be eleven miles,<br/>
			And be not less than half a mile across.</p>
			<p>For them am I in such a family;<br/>
			They did induce me into coining florins,<br/>
			Which had three carats of impurity."</p>
			<p>And I to him: "Who are the two poor wretches<br/>
			That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,<br/>
			Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?"</p>
			<p>"I found them here," replied he, "when I rained<br/>
			Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,<br/>
			Nor do I think they will for evermore.</p>
			<p>One the false woman is who accused Joseph,<br/>
			The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;<br/>
			From acute fever they send forth such reek."</p>
			<p>And one of them, who felt himself annoyed<br/>
			At being, peradventure, named so darkly,<br/>
			Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.</p>
			<p>It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;<br/>
			And Master Adam smote him in the face,<br/>
			With arm that did not seem to be less hard,</p>
			<p>Saying to him: "Although be taken from me<br/>
			All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,<br/>
			I have an arm unfettered for such need."</p>
			<p>Whereat he answer made: "When thou didst go<br/>
			Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:<br/>
			But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining."</p>
			<p>The dropsical: "Thou sayest true in that;<br/>
			But thou wast not so true a witness there,<br/>
			Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy."</p>
			<p>"If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,"<br/>
			Said Sinon; "and for one fault I am here,<br/>
			And thou for more than any other demon."</p>
			<p>"Remember, perjurer, about the horse,"<br/>
			He made reply who had the swollen belly,<br/>
			"And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it."</p>
			<p>"Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks<br/>
			Thy tongue," the Greek said, "and the putrid water<br/>
			That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes."</p>
			<p>Then the false-coiner: "So is gaping wide<br/>
			Thy mouth for speaking evil, as 'tis wont;<br/>
			Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me</p>
			<p>Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,<br/>
			And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus<br/>
			Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee."</p>
			<p>In listening to them was I wholly fixed,<br/>
			When said the Master to me: "Now just look,<br/>
			For little wants it that I quarrel with thee."</p>
			<p>When him I heard in anger speak to me,<br/>
			I turned me round towards him with such shame<br/>
			That still it eddies through my memory.</p>
			<p>And as he is who dreams of his own harm,<br/>
			Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,<br/>
			So that he craves what is, as if it were not;</p>
			<p>Such I became, not having power to speak,<br/>
			For to excuse myself I wished, and still<br/>
			Excused myself, and did not think I did it.</p>
			<p>"Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,"<br/>
			The Master said, "than this of thine has been;<br/>
			Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,</p>
			<p>And make account that I am aye beside thee,<br/>
			If e'er it come to pass that fortune bring thee<br/>
			Where there are people in a like dispute;</p>
			<p>For a base wish it is to wish to hear it."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXXI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,<br/>
			So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,<br/>
			And then held out to me the medicine;</p>
			<p>Thus do I hear that once Achilles' spear,<br/>
			His and his father's, used to be the cause<br/>
			First of a sad and then a gracious boon.</p>
			<p>We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,<br/>
			Upon the bank that girds it round about,<br/>
			Going across it without any speech.</p>
			<p>There it was less than night, and less than day,<br/>
			So that my sight went little in advance;<br/>
			But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,</p>
			<p>So loud it would have made each thunder faint,<br/>
			Which, counter to it following its way,<br/>
			Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.</p>
			<p>After the dolorous discomfiture<br/>
			When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,<br/>
			So terribly Orlando sounded not.</p>
			<p>Short while my head turned thitherward I held<br/>
			When many lofty towers I seemed to see,<br/>
			Whereat I: "Master, say, what town is this?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Because thou peerest forth<br/>
			Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,<br/>
			It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.</p>
			<p>Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,<br/>
			How much the sense deceives itself by distance;<br/>
			Therefore a little faster spur thee on."</p>
			<p>Then tenderly he took me by the hand,<br/>
			And said: "Before we farther have advanced,<br/>
			That the reality may seem to thee</p>
			<p>Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,<br/>
			And they are in the well, around the bank,<br/>
			From navel downward, one and all of them."</p>
			<p>As, when the fog is vanishing away,<br/>
			Little by little doth the sight refigure<br/>
			Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals,</p>
			<p>So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,<br/>
			More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge,<br/>
			My error fled, and fear came over me;</p>
			<p>Because as on its circular parapets<br/>
			Montereggione crowns itself with towers,<br/>
			E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well</p>
			<p>With one half of their bodies turreted<br/>
			The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces<br/>
			E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders.</p>
			<p>And I of one already saw the face,<br/>
			Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,<br/>
			And down along his sides both of the arms.</p>
			<p>Certainly Nature, when she left the making<br/>
			Of animals like these, did well indeed,<br/>
			By taking such executors from Mars;</p>
			<p>And if of elephants and whales she doth not<br/>
			Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly<br/>
			More just and more discreet will hold her for it;</p>
			<p>For where the argument of intellect<br/>
			Is added unto evil will and power,<br/>
			No rampart can the people make against it.</p>
			<p>His face appeared to me as long and large<br/>
			As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's,<br/>
			And in proportion were the other bones;</p>
			<p>So that the margin, which an apron was<br/>
			Down from the middle, showed so much of him<br/>
			Above it, that to reach up to his hair</p>
			<p>Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;<br/>
			For I beheld thirty great palms of him<br/>
			Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.</p>
			<p>"Raphael mai amech izabi almi,"<br/>
			Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,<br/>
			To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.</p>
			<p>And unto him my Guide: "Soul idiotic,<br/>
			Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,<br/>
			When wrath or other passion touches thee.</p>
			<p>Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt<br/>
			Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,<br/>
			And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast."</p>
			<p>Then said to me: "He doth himself accuse;<br/>
			This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought<br/>
			One language in the world is not still used.</p>
			<p>Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;<br/>
			For even such to him is every language<br/>
			As his to others, which to none is known."</p>
			<p>Therefore a longer journey did we make,<br/>
			Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft<br/>
			We found another far more fierce and large.</p>
			<p>In binding him, who might the master be<br/>
			I cannot say; but he had pinioned close<br/>
			Behind the right arm, and in front the other,</p>
			<p>With chains, that held him so begirt about<br/>
			From the neck down, that on the part uncovered<br/>
			It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.</p>
			<p>"This proud one wished to make experiment<br/>
			Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,"<br/>
			My Leader said, "whence he has such a guerdon.</p>
			<p>Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.<br/>
			What time the giants terrified the gods;<br/>
			The arms he wielded never more he moves."</p>
			<p>And I to him: "If possible, I should wish<br/>
			That of the measureless Briareus<br/>
			These eyes of mine might have experience."</p>
			<p>Whence he replied: "Thou shalt behold Antaeus<br/>
			Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,<br/>
			Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.</p>
			<p>Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,<br/>
			And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,<br/>
			Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious."</p>
			<p>There never was an earthquake of such might<br/>
			That it could shake a tower so violently,<br/>
			As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.</p>
			<p>Then was I more afraid of death than ever,<br/>
			For nothing more was needful than the fear,<br/>
			If I had not beheld the manacles.</p>
			<p>Then we proceeded farther in advance,<br/>
			And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells<br/>
			Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.</p>
			<p>"O thou, who in the valley fortunate,<br/>
			Which Scipio the heir of glory made,<br/>
			When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,</p>
			<p>Once brought'st a thousand lions for thy prey,<br/>
			And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war<br/>
			Among thy brothers, some it seems still think</p>
			<p>The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:<br/>
			Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,<br/>
			There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.</p>
			<p>Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;<br/>
			This one can give of that which here is longed for;<br/>
			Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.</p>
			<p>Still in the world can he restore thy fame;<br/>
			Because he lives, and still expects long life,<br/>
			If to itself Grace call him not untimely."</p>
			<p>So said the Master; and in haste the other<br/>
			His hands extended and took up my Guide,—<br/>
			Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.</p>
			<p>Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,<br/>
			Said unto me: "Draw nigh, that I may take thee;"<br/>
			Then of himself and me one bundle made.</p>
			<p>As seems the Carisenda, to behold<br/>
			Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud<br/>
			Above it so that opposite it hangs;</p>
			<p>Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood<br/>
			Watching to see him stoop, and then it was<br/>
			I could have wished to go some other way.</p>
			<p>But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up<br/>
			Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;<br/>
			Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,</p>
			<p>But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXXII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,<br/>
			As were appropriate to the dismal hole<br/>
			Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,</p>
			<p>I would press out the juice of my conception<br/>

			Not without fear I bring myself to speak;</p>
			<p>For 'tis no enterprise to take in jest,<br/>

			<p>O rabble ill-begotten above all,<br/>

			'Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!</p>
			<p>When we were down within the darksome well,<br/>
			Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far,<br/>
			And I was scanning still the lofty wall,</p>
			<p>I heard it said to me: "Look how thou steppest!<br/>
			Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet<br/>
			The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!"</p>
			<p>Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me<br/>
			And underfoot a lake, that from the frost<br/>
			The semblance had of glass, and not of water.</p>
			<p>So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current<br/>
			In winter-time Danube in Austria,<br/>
			Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,</p>
			<p>As there was here; so that if Tambernich<br/>
			Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,<br/>
			E'en at the edge 'twould not have given a creak.</p>
			<p>And as to croak the frog doth place himself<br/>
			With muzzle out of water,—when is dreaming<br/>
			Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,—</p>
			<p>Livid, as far down as where shame appears,<br/>
			Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,<br/>
			Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.</p>
			<p>Each one his countenance held downward bent;<br/>
			From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart<br/>
			Among them witness of itself procures.</p>
			<p>When round about me somewhat I had looked,<br/>
			I downward turned me, and saw two so close,<br/>
			The hair upon their heads together mingled.</p>
			<p>"Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,"<br/>
			I said, "who are you;" and they bent their necks,<br/>
			And when to me their faces they had lifted,</p>
			<p>Their eyes, which first were only moist within,<br/>
			Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed<br/>
			The tears between, and locked them up again.</p>
			<p>Clamp never bound together wood with wood<br/>
			So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,<br/>
			Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them.</p>
			<p>And one, who had by reason of the cold<br/>
			Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,<br/>
			Said: "Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?</p>
			<p>If thou desire to know who these two are,<br/>
			The valley whence Bisenzio descends<br/>
			Belonged to them and to their father Albert.</p>
			<p>They from one body came, and all Caina<br/>
			Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade<br/>
			More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;</p>
			<p>Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow<br/>
			At one and the same blow by Arthur's hand;<br/>
			Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers</p>
			<p>So with his head I see no farther forward,<br/>
			And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;<br/>
			Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.</p>
			<p>And that thou put me not to further speech,<br/>
			Know that I Camicion de' Pazzi was,<br/>
			And wait Carlino to exonerate me."</p>
			<p>Then I beheld a thousand faces, made<br/>
			Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder,<br/>
			And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.</p>
			<p>And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle,<br/>
			Where everything of weight unites together,<br/>
			And I was shivering in the eternal shade,</p>
			<p>Whether 'twere will, or destiny, or chance,<br/>
			I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads<br/>
			I struck my foot hard in the face of one.</p>
			<p>Weeping he growled: "Why dost thou trample me?<br/>
			Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance<br/>
			of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?"</p>
			<p>And I: "My Master, now wait here for me,<br/>
			That I through him may issue from a doubt;<br/>
			Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish."</p>
			<p>The Leader stopped; and to that one I said<br/>
			Who was blaspheming vehemently still:<br/>
			"Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?"</p>
			<p>"Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora<br/>
			Smiting," replied he, "other people's cheeks,<br/>
			So that, if thou wert living, 'twere too much?"</p>
			<p>"Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,"<br/>
			Was my response, "if thou demandest fame,<br/>
			That 'mid the other notes thy name I place."</p>
			<p>And he to me: "For the reverse I long;<br/>
			Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;<br/>
			For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow."</p>
			<p>Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,<br/>
			And said: "It must needs be thou name thyself,<br/>
			Or not a hair remain upon thee here."</p>
			<p>Whence he to me: "Though thou strip off my hair,<br/>
			I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,<br/>
			If on my head a thousand times thou fall."</p>
			<p>I had his hair in hand already twisted,<br/>
			And more than one shock of it had pulled out,<br/>
			He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,</p>
			<p>When cried another: "What doth ail thee, Bocca?<br/>
			Is't not enough to clatter with thy jaws,<br/>
			But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?"</p>
			<p>"Now," said I, "I care not to have thee speak,<br/>
			Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame<br/>
			I will report of thee veracious news."</p>
			<p>"Begone," replied he, "and tell what thou wilt,<br/>
			But be not silent, if thou issue hence,<br/>
			Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;</p>
			<p>He weepeth here the silver of the French;<br/>
			'I saw,' thus canst thou phrase it, 'him of Duera<br/>
			There where the sinners stand out in the cold.'</p>
			<p>If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,<br/>
			Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,<br/>
			Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;</p>
			<p>Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be<br/>
			Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello<br/>
			Who oped Faenza when the people slep."</p>
			<p>Already we had gone away from him,<br/>
			When I beheld two frozen in one hole,<br/>
			So that one head a hood was to the other;</p>
			<p>And even as bread through hunger is devoured,<br/>
			The uppermost on the other set his teeth,<br/>
			There where the brain is to the nape united.</p>
			<p>Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed<br/>
			The temples of Menalippus in disdain,<br/>
			Than that one did the skull and the other things.</p>
			<p>"O thou, who showest by such bestial sign<br/>
			Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,<br/>
			Tell me the wherefore," said I, "with this compact,</p>
			<p>That if thou rightfully of him complain,<br/>
			In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,<br/>
			I in the world above repay thee for it,</p>
			<p>If that wherewith I speak be not dried up."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXXIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,<br/>
			That sinner, wiping it upon the hair<br/>
			Of the same head that he behind had wasted.</p>
			<p>Then he began: "Thou wilt that I renew<br/>
			The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already<br/>
			To think of only, ere I speak of it;</p>
			<p>But if my words be seed that may bear fruit<br/>
			Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,<br/>
			Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.</p>
			<p>I know not who thou art, nor by what mode<br/>

			Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.</p>
			<p>Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,<br/>
			And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;<br/>
			Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.</p>
			<p>That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,<br/>

			Which of the future rent for me the veil.</p>
			<p>This one appeared to me as lord and master,<br/>

			For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.</p>
			<p>With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,<br/>
			Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi<br/>
			He had sent out before him to the front.</p>
			<p>After brief course seemed unto me forespent<br/>
			The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes<br/>
			It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.</p>
			<p>When I before the morrow was awake,<br/>
			Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons<br/>
			Who with me were, and asking after bread.</p>
			<p>Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,<br/>
			Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,<br/>
			And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?</p>
			<p>They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh<br/>
			At which our food used to be brought to us,<br/>
			And through his dream was each one apprehensive;</p>
			<p>And I heard locking up the under door<br/>
			Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word<br/>
			I gazed into the faces of my sons.</p>
			<p>I wept not, I within so turned to stone;<br/>
			They wept; and darling little Anselm mine<br/>
			Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?'</p>
			<p>Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made<br/>
			All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,<br/>
			Until another sun rose on the world.</p>
			<p>As now a little glimmer made its way<br/>
			Into the dolorous prison, and I saw<br/>
			Upon four faces my own very aspect,</p>
			<p>Both of my hands in agony I bit;<br/>
			And, thinking that I did it from desire<br/>
			Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,</p>
			<p>And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us<br/>
			If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us<br/>
			With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.'</p>
			<p>I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.<br/>
			That day we all were silent, and the next.<br/>
			Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?</p>
			<p>When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo<br/>
			Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,<br/>
			Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?'</p>
			<p>And there he died; and, as thou seest me,<br/>
			I saw the three fall, one by one, between<br/>
			The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,</p>
			<p>Already blind, to groping over each,<br/>
			And three days called them after they were dead;<br/>
			Then hunger did what sorrow could not do."</p>
			<p>When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,<br/>
			The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,<br/>
			Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong.</p>
			<p>Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people<br/>
			Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound,<br/>
			Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,</p>
			<p>Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,<br/>
			And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno<br/>
			That every person in thee it may drown!</p>
			<p>For if Count Ugolino had the fame<br/>
			Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,<br/>
			Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.</p>
			<p>Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!<br/>
			Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,<br/>
			And the other two my song doth name above!</p>
			<p>We passed still farther onward, where the ice<br/>
			Another people ruggedly enswathes,<br/>
			Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.</p>
			<p>Weeping itself there does not let them weep,<br/>
			And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes<br/>
			Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;</p>
			<p>Because the earliest tears a cluster form,<br/>
			And, in the manner of a crystal visor,<br/>
			Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.</p>
			<p>And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,<br/>
			Because of cold all sensibility<br/>
			Its station had abandoned in my face,</p>
			<p>Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;<br/>
			Whence I: "My Master, who sets this in motion?<br/>
			Is not below here every vapour quenched?"</p>
			<p>Whence he to me: "Full soon shalt thou be where<br/>
			Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,<br/>
			Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast."</p>
			<p>And one of the wretches of the frozen crust<br/>
			Cried out to us: "O souls so merciless<br/>
			That the last post is given unto you,</p>
			<p>Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I<br/>
			May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart<br/>
			A little, e'er the weeping recongeal."</p>
			<p>Whence I to him: "If thou wouldst have me help thee<br/>
			Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,<br/>
			May I go to the bottom of the ice."</p>
			<p>Then he replied: "I am Friar Alberigo;<br/>
			He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,<br/>
			Who here a date am getting for my fig."</p>
			<p>"O," said I to him, "now art thou, too, dead?"<br/>
			And he to me: "How may my body fare<br/>
			Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.</p>
			<p>Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,<br/>
			That oftentimes the soul descendeth here<br/>
			Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.</p>
			<p>And, that thou mayest more willingly remove<br/>
			From off my countenance these glassy tears,<br/>
			Know that as soon as any soul betrays</p>
			<p>As I have done, his body by a demon<br/>
			Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,<br/>
			Until his time has wholly been revolved.</p>
			<p>Itself down rushes into such a cistern;<br/>
			And still perchance above appears the body<br/>
			Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.</p>
			<p>This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;<br/>
			It is Ser Branca d' Oria, and many years<br/>
			Have passed away since he was thus locked up."</p>
			<p>"I think," said I to him, "thou dost deceive me;<br/>
			For Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet,<br/>
			And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes."</p>
			<p>"In moat above," said he, "of Malebranche,<br/>
			There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,<br/>
			As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,</p>
			<p>When this one left a devil in his stead<br/>
			In his own body and one near of kin,<br/>
			Who made together with him the betrayal.</p>
			<p>But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,<br/>
			Open mine eyes;"—and open them I did not,<br/>
			And to be rude to him was courtesy.</p>
			<p>Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance<br/>
			With every virtue, full of every vice<br/>
			Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?</p>
			<p>For with the vilest spirit of Romagna<br/>
			I found of you one such, who for his deeds<br/>
			In soul already in Cocytus bathes,</p>
			<p>And still above in body seems alive!</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXXIV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">"'Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni'<br/>
			Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,"<br/>
			My Master said, "if thou discernest him."</p>
			<p>As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when<br/>
			Our hemisphere is darkening into night,<br/>
			Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,</p>
			<p>Methought that such a building then I saw;<br/>
			And, for the wind, I drew myself behind<br/>
			My Guide, because there was no other shelter.</p>
			<p>Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,<br/>
			There where the shades were wholly covered up,<br/>
			And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.</p>
			<p>Some prone are lying, others stand erect,<br/>
			This with the head, and that one with the soles;<br/>
			Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.</p>
			<p>When in advance so far we had proceeded,<br/>
			That it my Master pleased to show to me<br/>
			The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,</p>
			<p>He from before me moved and made me stop,<br/>
			Saying: "Behold Dis, and behold the place<br/>
			Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself."</p>
			<p>How frozen I became and powerless then,<br/>
			Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,<br/>
			Because all language would be insufficient.</p>
			<p>I did not die, and I alive remained not;<br/>
			Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,<br/>
			What I became, being of both deprived.</p>
			<p>The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous<br/>
			From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;<br/>
			And better with a giant I compare</p>
			<p>Than do the giants with those arms of his;<br/>
			Consider now how great must be that whole,<br/>
			Which unto such a part conforms itself.</p>
			<p>Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,<br/>
			And lifted up his brow against his Maker,<br/>
			Well may proceed from him all tribulation.</p>
			<p>O, what a marvel it appeared to me,<br/>
			When I beheld three faces on his head!<br/>
			The one in front, and that vermilion was;</p>
			<p>Two were the others, that were joined with this<br/>
			Above the middle part of either shoulder,<br/>
			And they were joined together at the crest;</p>
			<p>And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;<br/>
			The left was such to look upon as those<br/>
			Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.</p>
			<p>Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,<br/>
			Such as befitting were so great a bird;<br/>
			Sails of the sea I never saw so large.</p>
			<p>No feathers had they, but as of a bat<br/>
			Their fashion was; and he was waving them,<br/>
			So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.</p>
			<p>Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.<br/>
			With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins<br/>
			Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.</p>
			<p>At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching<br/>
			A sinner, in the manner of a brake,<br/>
			So that he three of them tormented thus.</p>
			<p>To him in front the biting was as naught<br/>
			Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine<br/>
			Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.</p>
			<p>"That soul up there which has the greatest pain,"<br/>
			The Master said, "is Judas Iscariot;<br/>
			With head inside, he plies his legs without.</p>
			<p>Of the two others, who head downward are,<br/>
			The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;<br/>
			See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.</p>
			<p>And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.<br/>
			But night is reascending, and 'tis time<br/>
			That we depart, for we have seen the whole."</p>
			<p>As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,<br/>
			And he the vantage seized of time and place,<br/>
			And when the wings were opened wide apart,</p>
			<p>He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;<br/>
			From fell to fell descended downward then<br/>
			Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.</p>
			<p>When we were come to where the thigh revolves<br/>
			Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,<br/>
			The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,</p>
			<p>Turned round his head where he had had his legs,<br/>
			And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,<br/>
			So that to Hell I thought we were returning.</p>
			<p>"Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,"<br/>
			The Master said, panting as one fatigued,<br/>
			"Must we perforce depart from so much evil."</p>
			<p>Then through the opening of a rock he issued,<br/>
			And down upon the margin seated me;<br/>
			Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.</p>
			<p>I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see<br/>
			Lucifer in the same way I had left him;<br/>
			And I beheld him upward hold his legs.</p>
			<p>And if I then became disquieted,<br/>
			Let stolid people think who do not see<br/>
			What the point is beyond which I had passed.</p>
			<p>"Rise up," the Master said, "upon thy feet;<br/>
			The way is long, and difficult the road,<br/>
			And now the sun to middle-tierce returns."</p>
			<p>It was not any palace corridor<br/>
			There where we were, but dungeon natural,<br/>
			With floor uneven and unease of light.</p>
			<p>"Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,<br/>
			My Master," said I when I had arisen,<br/>
			"To draw me from an error speak a little;</p>
			<p>Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed<br/>
			Thus upside down? and how in such short time<br/>
			From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?"</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Thou still imaginest<br/>
			Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped<br/>
			The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.</p>
			<p>That side thou wast, so long as I descended;<br/>
			When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point<br/>
			To which things heavy draw from every side,</p>
			<p>And now beneath the hemisphere art come<br/>
			Opposite that which overhangs the vast<br/>
			Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death</p>
			<p>The Man who without sin was born and lived.<br/>
			Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere<br/>
			Which makes the other face of the Judecca.</p>
			<p>Here it is morn when it is evening there;<br/>
			And he who with his hair a stairway made us<br/>
			Still fixed remaineth as he was before.</p>
			<p>Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;<br/>
			And all the land, that whilom here emerged,<br/>
			For fear of him made of the sea a veil,</p>
			<p>And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure<br/>
			To flee from him, what on this side appears<br/>
			Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled."</p>
			<p>A place there is below, from Beelzebub<br/>
			As far receding as the tomb extends,<br/>
			Which not by sight is known, but by the sound</p>
			<p>Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth<br/>
			Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed<br/>
			With course that winds about and slightly falls.</p>
			<p>The Guide and I into that hidden road<br/>
			Now entered, to return to the bright world;<br/>
			And without care of having any rest</p>
			<p>We mounted up, he first and I the second,<br/>
			Till I beheld through a round aperture<br/>
			Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;</p>
			<p>Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.</p>
