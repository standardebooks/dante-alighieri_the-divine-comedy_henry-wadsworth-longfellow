					<span>Oft have I seen at some cathedral door</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kneel to repeat his paternoster o’er;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far off the noises of the world retreat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The loud vociferations of the street</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Become an undistinguishable roar.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, as I enter here from day to day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And leave my burden at this minster gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tumult of the time disconsolate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To inarticulate murmurs dies away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While the eternal ages watch and wait.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How strange the sculptures that adorn these towers!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This crowd of statues, in whose folded sleeves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, underneath, the traitor Judas lowers!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah! from what agonies of heart and brain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What exultations trampling on despair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What passionate outcry of a soul in pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uprose this poem of the earth and air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This medieval miracle of song!</span>

				<p>
					<span>Midway upon the journey of our life</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I found myself within a forest dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in the very thought renews the fear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So bitter is it, death is little more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of the good to treat, which there I found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Speak will I of the other things I saw there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot well repeat how there I entered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So full was I of slumber at the moment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which I had abandoned the true way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But after I had reached a mountain’s foot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At that point where the valley terminated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had with consternation pierced my heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vested already with that planet’s rays</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which leadeth others right by every road.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then was the fear a little quieted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in my heart’s lake had endured throughout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The night, which I had passed so piteously.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as he, who, with distressful breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turns to the water perilous and gazes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turn itself back to re-behold the pass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which never yet a living person left.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After my weary body I had rested,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The way resumed I on the desert slope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the firm foot ever was the lower.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! almost where the ascent began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A panther light and swift exceedingly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with a spotted skin was covered o’er!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And never moved she from before my face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nay, rather did impede so much my way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That many times I to return had turned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The time was the beginning of the morning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And up the sun was mounting with those stars</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with him were, what time the Love Divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At first in motion set those beauteous things;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So were to me occasion of good hope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The variegated skin of that wild beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hour of time, and the delicious season;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not so much, that did not give me fear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A lion’s aspect which appeared to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He seemed as if against me he were coming</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many folk has caused to live forlorn!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She brought upon me so much heaviness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the affright that from her aspect came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I the hope relinquished of the height.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he is who willingly acquires,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the time comes that causes him to lose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en such made me that beast withouten peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, coming on against me by degrees</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While I was rushing downward to the lowland,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before mine eyes did one present himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I beheld him in the desert vast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Have pity on me,” unto him I cried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Whiche’er thou art, or shade or real man!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He answered me: “Not man; man once I was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both my parents were of Lombardy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Mantuans by country both of them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>Sub Julio</i> was I born, though it was late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">During the time of false and lying gods.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A poet was I, and I sang that just</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After that Ilion the superb was burned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why climb’st thou not the Mount Delectable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is the source and cause of every joy?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I made response to him with bashful forehead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O, of the other poets honour and light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Avail me the long study and great love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That have impelled me to explore thy volume!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art my master, and my author thou,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou art alone the one from whom I took</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The beautiful style that has done honour to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thee it behoves to take another road,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because this beast, at which thou criest out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suffers not any one to pass her way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And has a nature so malign and ruthless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never doth she glut her greedy will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after food is hungrier than before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many the animals with whom she weds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On whose account the maid Camilla died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through every city shall he hunt her down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There from whence envy first did let her loose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I think and judge it for thy best</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lead thee hence through the eternal place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who cry out each one for the second death;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou shalt see those who contented are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the fire, because they hope to come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whene’er it may be, to the blessed people;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With her at my departure I will leave thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that Emperor, who reigns above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In that I was rebellious to his law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wills that through me none come into his city.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There is his city and his lofty throne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O happy he whom thereto he elects!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “Poet, I thee entreat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By that same God whom thou didst never know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that I may escape this woe and worse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And those thou makest so disconsolate.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</span>

					<span>Day was departing, and the embrowned air</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Released the animals that are on earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From their fatigues; and I the only one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made myself ready to sustain the war,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of the way and likewise of the woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which memory that errs not shall retrace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O memory, that didst write down what I saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here thy nobility shall be manifest!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I began: “Poet, who guidest me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While yet corruptible, unto the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Immortal went, and was there bodily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if the adversary of all evil</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was courteous, thinking of the high effect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That issue would from him, and who, and what,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he was of great Rome, and of her empire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were stablished as the holy place, wherein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Things did he hear, which the occasion were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of his victory and the papal mantle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of salvation’s way is the beginning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore, if I resign myself to come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I fear the coming may be ill-advised;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou’rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he is, who unwills what he willed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by new thoughts doth his intention change,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that from his design he quite withdraws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such I became, upon that dark hillside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was so very prompt in the beginning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If I have well thy language understood,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which many times a man encumbers so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It turns him back from honoured enterprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I’ll tell thee why I came, and what I heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the first moment when I grieved for thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among those was I who are in suspense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And a fair, saintly Lady called to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In such wise, I besought her to command me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And she began to say, gentle and low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With voice angelical, in her own language:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘O spirit courteous of Mantua,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom the fame still in the world endures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the desert slope is so impeded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And may, I fear, already be so lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I too late have risen to his succour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with what needful is for his release,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Assist him so, that I may be consoled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I come from there, where I would fain return;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I shall be in presence of my Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full often will I praise thee unto him.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then paused she, and thereafter I began:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The human race exceedeth all contained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So grateful unto me is thy commandment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To obey, if ’twere already done, were late;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No farther need’st thou ope to me thy wish.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The here descending down into this centre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the vast place thou burnest to return to.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Briefly will I relate,’ she answered me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">‘Why I am not afraid to enter here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of those things only should one be afraid</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which have the power of doing others harm;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God in his mercy such created me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That misery of yours attains me not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor any flame assails me of this burning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At this impediment, to which I send thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that stern judgment there above is broken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In her entreaty she besought Lucia,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said, “Thy faithful one now stands in need</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hastened away, and came unto the place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Beatrice” said she, “the true praise of God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dost thou not see the death that combats him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never were persons in the world so swift</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To work their weal and to escape their woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I, after such words as these were uttered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came hither downward from my blessed seat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Confiding in thy dignified discourse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which honours thee, and those who’ve listened to it.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After she thus had spoken unto me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto thee I came, as she desired;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I have delivered thee from that wild beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which barred the beautiful mountain’s short ascent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What is it, then? Why, why dost thou delay?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeing that three such Ladies benedight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so much good my speech doth promise thee?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uplift themselves all open on their stems;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such I became with my exhausted strength,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And such good courage to my heart there coursed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I began, like an intrepid person:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O she compassionate, who succoured me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The words of truth which she addressed to thee!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the adventure, with these words of thine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to my first intent I have returned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now go, for one sole will is in us both,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I entered on the deep and savage way.</span>

					<span>“Through me the way is to the city dolent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through me the way is to eternal dole;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through me the way among the people lost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Justice incited my sublime Creator;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Created me divine Omnipotence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before me there were no created things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only eterne, and I eternal last.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All hope abandon, ye who enter in!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These words in sombre colour I beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Written upon the summit of a gate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I: “Their sense is, Master, hard to me!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me, as one experienced:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All cowardice must needs be here extinct.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We to the place have come, where I have told thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shalt behold the people dolorous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who have foregone the good of intellect.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after he had laid his hand on mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He led me in among the secret things.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Resounded through the air without a star,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Languages diverse, horrible dialects,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accents of anger, words of agony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made up a tumult that goes whirling on</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forever in that air forever black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who had my head with horror bound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Master, what is this which now I hear?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “This miserable mode</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Maintain the melancholy souls of those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who lived withouten infamy or praise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Commingled are they with that caitiff choir</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For glory none the damned would have from them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “O Master, what so grievous is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To these, that maketh them lament so sore?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He answered: “I will tell thee very briefly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These have no longer any hope of death;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this blind life of theirs is so debased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They envious are of every other fate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No fame of them the world permits to be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Misericord and Justice both disdain them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after it there came so long a train</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of people, that I ne’er would have believed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever Death so many had undone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When some among them I had recognised,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I looked, and I beheld the shade of him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who made through cowardice the great refusal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hateful to God and to his enemies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These miscreants, who never were alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were naked, and were stung exceedingly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By gadflies and by hornets that were there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These did their faces irrigate with blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the disgusting worms was gathered up.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when to gazing farther I betook me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">People I saw on a great river’s bank;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence said I: “Master, now vouchsafe to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I may know who these are, and what law</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Makes them appear so ready to pass over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I discern athwart the dusky light.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “These things shall all be known</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the dismal shore of Acheron.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fearing my words might irksome be to him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From speech refrained I till we reached the river.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! towards us coming in a boat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying: “Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I come to lead you to the other shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the eternal shades in heat and frost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when he saw that I did not withdraw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said: “By other ways, by other ports</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto him the Guide: “Vex thee not, Charon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It is so willed there where is power to do</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which is willed; and farther question not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all those souls who weary were and naked</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As soon as they had heard those cruel words.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God they blasphemed and their progenitors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The human race, the place, the time, the seed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of their engendering and of their birth!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter all together they drew back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which waiteth every man who fears not God.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beckoning to them, collects them all together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First one and then another, till the branch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In similar wise the evil seed of Adam</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throw themselves from that margin one by one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At signals, as a bird unto its lure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So they depart across the dusky wave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ere upon the other side they land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Again on this side a new troop assembles.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My son,” the courteous Master said to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“All those who perish in the wrath of God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here meet together out of every land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ready are they to pass o’er the river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because celestial Justice spurs them on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that their fear is turned into desire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This way there never passes a good soul;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This being finished, all the dusk champaign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trembled so violently, that of that terror</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The recollection bathes me still with sweat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fulminated a vermilion light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which overmastered in me every sense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</span>

				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Broke the deep lethargy within my head</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a person who by force is wakened;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And round about I moved my rested eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To recognise the place wherein I was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True is it, that upon the verge I found me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the abysmal valley dolorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that by fixing on its depths my sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nothing whatever I discerned therein.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Let us descend now into the blind world,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began the Poet, pallid utterly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“I will be first, and thou shalt second be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who of his colour was aware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “How shall I come, if thou art afraid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who’rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “The anguish of the people</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who are below here in my face depicts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That pity which for terror thou hast taken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us go on, for the long way impels us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, as it seemed to me from listening,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were lamentations none, but only sighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That tremble made the everlasting air.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this arose from sorrow without torment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the crowds had, that many were and great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of infants and of women and of men.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To me the Master good: “Thou dost not ask</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they sinned not; and if they merit had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis not enough, because they had not baptism</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if they were before Christianity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the right manner they adored not God;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And among such as these am I myself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For such defects, and not for other guilt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lost are we and are only so far punished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That without hope we live on in desire.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because some people of much worthiness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began I, with desire of being certain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that Faith which o’ercometh every error,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Came any one by his own merit hence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or by another’s, who was blessed thereafter?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he, who understood my covert speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Replied: “I was a novice in this state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I saw hither come a Mighty One,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sign of victory incoronate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Israel with his father and his children,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And others many, and he made them blessed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou must know, that earlier than these</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Never were any human spirits saved.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We ceased not to advance because he spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But still were passing onward through the forest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not very far as yet our way had gone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This side the summit, when I saw a fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We were a little distant from it still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not so far that I in part discerned not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That honourable people held that place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou who honourest every art and science,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who may these be, which such great honour have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “The honourable name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sounds of them above there in thy life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the meantime a voice was heard by me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“All honour be to the preeminent Poet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His shade returns again, that was departed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the voice had ceased and quiet was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To say to me began my gracious Master:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Him with that falchion in his hand behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who comes before the three, even as their lord.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because to each of these with me applies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The name that solitary voice proclaimed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They do me honour, and in that do well.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus I beheld assemble the fair school</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that lord of the song preeminent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who o’er the others like an eagle soars.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they together had discoursed somewhat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They turned to me with signs of salutation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on beholding this, my Master smiled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And more of honour still, much more, they did me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In that they made me one of their own band;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the sixth was I, ’mid so much wit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus we went on as far as to the light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Things saying ’tis becoming to keep silent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As was the saying of them where I was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We came unto a noble castle’s foot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Defended round by a fair rivulet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This we passed over even as firm ground;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>People were there with solemn eyes and slow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of great authority in their countenance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into an opening luminous and lofty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that they all of them were visible.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There opposite, upon the green enamel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw Electra with companions many,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw Camilla and Penthesilea</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I had lifted up my brows a little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Master I beheld of those who know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sit with his philosophic family.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who nearer him before the others stand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Democritus, who puts the world on chance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of qualities I saw the good collector,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Averroes, who the great Comment made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot all of them pourtray in full,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because so drives me onward the long theme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That many times the word comes short of fact.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sixfold company in two divides;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another way my sapient Guide conducts me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to a place I come where nothing shines.</span>

					<p epub:type="bridgehead">The Second Circle⁠—Minos⁠—The Wanton⁠—The Infernal Hurricane⁠—Francesca da Rimini.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Thus I descended out of the first circle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down to the second, that less space begirds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Examines the transgressions at the entrance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Judges, and sends according as he girds him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say, that when the spirit evil-born</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this discriminator of transgressions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Girds himself with his tail as many times</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Always before him many of them stand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They go by turns each one unto the judgment;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comest,” said Minos to me, when he saw me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Leaving the practice of so great an office,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let not the portal’s amplitude deceive thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And unto him my Guide: “Why criest thou too?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It is so willed there where is power to do</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which is willed; and ask no further question.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now begin the dolesome notes to grow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Audible unto me; now am I come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where much lamentation strikes upon me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I came into a place mute of all light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If by opposing winds ’tis combated.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The infernal hurricane that never rests</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they arrive before the precipice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There they blaspheme the puissance divine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I understood that unto such a torment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The carnal malefactors were condemned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who reason subjugate to appetite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as the wings of starlings bear them on</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the cold season in large band and full,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So doth that blast the spirits maledict;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No hope doth comfort them for evermore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making in air a long line of themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereupon said I: “Master, who are those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">People, whom the black air so castigates?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The first of those, of whom intelligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou fain wouldst have,” then said he unto me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“The empress was of many languages.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sensual vices she was so abandoned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That lustful she made licit in her law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To remove the blame to which she had been led.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She is Semiramis, of whom we read</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She held the land which now the Sultan rules.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The next is she who killed herself for love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then Cleopatra the voluptuous.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who at the last hour combated with Love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shades did he name and point out with his finger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom Love had separated from our life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After that I had listened to my Teacher,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I began: “O Poet, willingly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Speak would I to those two, who go together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And seem upon the wind to be so light.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, he to me: “Thou’lt mark, when they shall be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By love which leadeth them, and they will come.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My voice uplift I: “O ye weary souls!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As turtledoves, called onward by desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With open and steady wings to the sweet nest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fly through the air by their volition borne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So came they from the band where Dido is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Approaching us athwart the air malign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So strong was the affectionate appeal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O living creature gracious and benignant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who visiting goest through the purple air</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If were the King of the Universe our friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We would pray unto him to give thee peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That will we hear, and we will speak to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While silent is the wind, as it is now.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the seashore where the Po descends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rest in peace with all his retinue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seized this man for the person beautiful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was ta’en from me, and still the mode offends me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love has conducted us unto one death;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These words were borne along from them to us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I bowed my face, and so long held it down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the Poet said to me: “What thinkest?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I made answer, I began: “Alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I began: “Thine agonies, Francesca,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By what and in what manner Love conceded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That you should know your dubious desires?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she to me: “There is no greater sorrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than to be mindful of the happy time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, if to recognise the earliest root</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of love in us thou hast so great desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One day we reading were for our delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Alone we were and without any fear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full many a time our eyes together drew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But one point only was it that o’ercame us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When as we read of the much-longed-for smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being by such a noble lover kissed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This one, who ne’er from me shall be divided,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That day no farther did we read therein.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the while one spirit uttered this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other one did weep so, that, for pity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I swooned away as if I had been dying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fell, even as a dead body falls.</span>

				<p>
					<span>At the return of consciousness, that closed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the pity of those two relations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which utterly with sadness had confused me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>New torments I behold, and new tormented</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Around me, whichsoever way I move,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the third circle am I of the rain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its law and quality are never new.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his three gullets like a dog is barking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Over the people that are there submerged.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One side they make a shelter for the other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not a limb had he that was motionless.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my Conductor, with his spans extended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He threw it into those rapacious gullets.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We passed across the shadows, which subdues</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The heavy rainstorm, and we placed our feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon their vanity that person seems.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all were lying prone upon the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Excepting one, who sat upright as soon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he beheld us passing on before him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou that art conducted through this Hell,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said to me, “recall me, if thou canst;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thyself wast made before I was unmade.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “The anguish which thou hast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A place art put, and in such punishment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If some are greater, none is so displeasing.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Thy city, which is full</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of envy so that now the sack runs over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Held me within it in the life serene.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the pernicious sin of gluttony</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, sad soul, am not the only one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all these suffer the like penalty</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the like sin;” and word no more spake he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I answered him: “Ciacco, thy wretchedness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The citizens of the divided city;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If any there be just; and the occasion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell me why so much discord has assailed it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “They, after long contention,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will drive the other out with much offence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then afterwards behoves it this one fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within three suns, and rise again the other</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By force of him who now is on the coast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>High will it hold its forehead a long while,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Keeping the other under heavy burdens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Howe’er it weeps thereat and is indignant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The just are two, and are not understood there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Envy and Arrogance and Avarice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here ended he his tearful utterance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I to him: “I wish thee still to teach me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And make a gift to me of further speech.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For great desire constraineth me to learn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “They are among the blacker souls;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when thou art again in the sweet world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more I tell thee and no more I answer.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He fell therewith prone like the other blind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Guide said to me: “He wakes no more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When shall approach the hostile Potentate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall hear what through eternity reechoes.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So we passed onward o’er the filthy mixture</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Touching a little on the future life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore I said: “Master, these torments here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will they increase after the mighty sentence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Return unto thy science,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Albeit that this people maledict</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To true perfection never can attain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hereafter more than now they look to be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Round in a circle by that road we went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We came unto the point where the descent is;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There we found Plutus the great enemy.</span>

					<span>“Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!”</span>

					<span class="i1">Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;</span>

					<span class="i1">And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said, to encourage me: “Let not thy fear</span>

					<span class="i1">Shall not prevent thy going down this crag.”</span>

					<span class="i1">And said: “Be silent, thou accursed wolf;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,</span>

					<span class="i1">New toils and sufferings as I beheld?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And why doth our transgression waste us so?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That breaks itself on that which it encounters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So here the folk must dance their roundelay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On one side and the other, with great howls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They clashed together, and then at that point</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying, “Why keepest?” and, “Why squanderest thou?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus they returned along the lurid circle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On either hand unto the opposite point,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shouting their shameful metre evermore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through his half-circle to another joust;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exclaimed: “My Master, now declare to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What people these are, and if all were clerks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These shaven crowns upon the left of us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “All of them were asquint</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In intellect in the first life, so much</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That there with measure they no spending made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whene’er they reach the two points of the circle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where sunders them the opposite defect.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clerks those were who no hairy covering</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In whom doth Avarice practise its excess.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, among such as these</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I ought forsooth to recognise some few,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who were infected with these maladies.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Vain thought thou entertainest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The undiscerning life which made them sordid</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now makes them unto all discernment dim.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forever shall they come to these two buttings;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These from the sepulchre shall rise again</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have ta’en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whate’er it be, no words adorn I for it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which the human race each other buffet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the gold that is beneath the moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever has been, of these weary souls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could never make a single one repose.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Master,” I said to him, “now tell me also</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That has the world’s goods so within its clutches?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “O creatures imbecile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What ignorance is this which doth beset you?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He whose omniscience everything transcends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That every part to every part may shine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distributing the light in equal measure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He in like manner to the mundane splendours</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ordained a general ministress and guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she might change at times the empty treasures</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From race to race, from one blood to another,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore one people triumphs, and another</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She makes provision, judges, and pursues</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her governance, as theirs the other gods.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her permutations have not any truce;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Necessity makes her precipitate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So often cometh who his turn obtains.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this is she who is so crucified</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even by those who ought to give her praise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But she is blissful, and she hears it not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the other primal creatures gladsome</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us descend now unto greater woe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already sinks each star that was ascending</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I set out, and loitering is forbidden.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We crossed the circle to the other bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along a gully that runs out of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The water was more sombre far than perse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And we, in company with the dusky waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This tristful brooklet, when it has descended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who stood intent upon beholding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All of them naked and with angry look.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They smote each other not alone with hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with the head and with the breast and feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said the good Master: “Son, thou now beholdest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The souls of those whom anger overcame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And likewise I would have thee know for certain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath the water people are who sigh</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And make this water bubble at the surface,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As the eye tells thee wheresoe’er it turns.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fixed in the mire they say, ‘We sullen were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now we are sullen in this sable mire.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For with unbroken words they cannot say it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus we went circling round the filthy fen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A great arc ’twixt the dry bank and the swamp,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.</span>

				<p>
					<span>I say, continuing, that long before</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We to the foot of that high tower had come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from afar another answer them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, to the sea of all discernment turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said: “What sayeth this, and what respondeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That other fire? and who are they that made it?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Across the turbid waves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What is expected thou canst now discern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If reek of the morass conceal it not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cord never shot an arrow from itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sped away athwart the air so swift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I beheld a very little boat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come o’er the water tow’rds us at that moment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under the guidance of a single pilot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who shouted, “Now art thou arrived, fell soul?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For this once,” said my Lord; “thou shalt not have us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Longer than in the passing of the slough.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he who listens to some great deceit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That has been done to him, and then resents it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Guide descended down into the boat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then he made me enter after him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And only when I entered seemed it laden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The antique prow goes on its way, dividing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More of the water than ’tis wont with others.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While we were running through the dead canal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uprose in front of me one full of mire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said, “Who ’rt thou that comest ere the hour?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “Although I come, I stay not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But who art thou that hast become so squalid?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Thou seest that I am one who weeps,” he answered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “With weeping and with wailing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying, “Away there with the other dogs!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He kissed my face, and said: “Disdainful soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was an arrogant person in the world;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Goodness is none, that decks his memory;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So likewise here his shade is furious.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How many are esteemed great kings up there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, much should I be pleased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I could see him soused into this broth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before we issue forth out of the lake.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Ere unto thee the shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such a desire ’tis meet thou shouldst enjoy.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little after that, I saw such havoc</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made of him by the people of the mire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That still I praise and thank my God for it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all were shouting, “At Philippo Argenti!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that exasperate spirit Florentine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We left him there, and more of him I tell not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the good Master said: “Even now, my Son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The city draweth near whose name is Dis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the grave citizens, with the great throng.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “Its mosques already, Master, clearly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within there in the valley I discern</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were.” And he to me: “The fire eternal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That kindles them within makes them look red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou beholdest in this nether Hell.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then we arrived within the moats profound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That circumvallate that disconsolate city;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The walls appeared to me to be of iron.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not without making first a circuit wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We came unto a place where loud the pilot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried out to us, “Debark, here is the entrance.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than a thousand at the gates I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were saying, “Who is this that without death</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And my sagacious Master made a sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of wishing secretly to speak with them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little then they quelled their great disdain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “Come thou alone, and he begone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who has so boldly entered these dominions.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let him return alone by his mad road;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Think, Reader, if I was discomforted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At utterance of the accursed words;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For never to return here I believed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O my dear Guide, who more than seven times</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hast rendered me security, and drawn me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From imminent peril that before me stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do not desert me,” said I, “thus undone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if the going farther be denied us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me: “Fear not; because our passage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">None can take from us, it by Such is given.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But here await me, and thy weary spirit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comfort and nourish with a better hope;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For in this nether world I will not leave thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So onward goes and there abandons me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For No and Yes within my head contend.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I could not hear what he proposed to them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with them there he did not linger long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere each within in rivalry ran back.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They closed the portals, those our adversaries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On my Lord’s breast, who had remained without</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turned to me with footsteps far between.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto me: “Thou, because I am angry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whatever for defence within be planned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For once they used it at less secret gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which finds itself without a fastening still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now this side of it descends the steep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Passing across the circles without escort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One by whose means the city shall be opened.”</span>

					<span>That hue which cowardice brought out on me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beholding my Conductor backward turn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sooner repressed within him his new colour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because the eye could not conduct him far</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Still it behoveth us to win the fight,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began he; “Else … Such offered us herself …</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O how I long that someone here arrive!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He covered up with what came afterward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they were words quite different from the first;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But none the less his saying gave me fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because I carried out the broken phrase,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Into this bottom of the doleful conch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth any e’er descend from the first grade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which for its pain has only hope cut off?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This question put I; and he answered me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Seldom it comes to pass that one of us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Maketh the journey upon which I go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True is it, once before I here below</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Naked of me short while the flesh had been,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before within that wall she made me enter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is the lowest region and the darkest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And farthest from the heaven which circles all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Encompasses about the city dolent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where now we cannot enter without anger.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And more he said, but not in mind I have it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because mine eye had altogether drawn me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tow’rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The three infernal Furies stained with blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who had the limbs of women and their mien,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with the greenest hydras were begirt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he who well the handmaids of the Queen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of everlasting lamentation knew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me: “Behold the fierce Erinnys.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tisiphone is between;” and then was silent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each one her breast was rending with her nails;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All shouted looking down; “in evil hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more returning upward would there be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus said the Master; and he turned me round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himself, and trusted not unto my hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So far as not to blind me with his own.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O ye who have undistempered intellects,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Observe the doctrine that conceals itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now there came across the turbid waves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because of which both of the margins trembled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not otherwise it was than of a wind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Impetuous on account of adverse heats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That smites the forest, and, without restraint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine eyes he loosed, and said: “Direct the nerve</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of vision now along that ancient foam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There yonder where that smoke is most intense.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Across the water scatter all abroad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until each one is huddled in the earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus fleeing from before one who on foot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was passing o’er the Styx with soles unwet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Waving his left hand oft in front of him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And only with that anguish seemed he weary.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the Master turned; and he made sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He reached the gate, and with a little rod</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He opened it, for there was no resistance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O banished out of Heaven, people despised!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Whence is this arrogance within you couched?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From which the end can never be cut off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And which has many times increased your pain?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What helpeth it to butt against the fates?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your Cerberus, if you remember well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he returned along the miry road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spake no word to us, but had the look</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of one whom other care constrains and goads</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than that of him who in his presence is;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And we our feet directed tow’rds the city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After those holy words all confident.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within we entered without any contest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I, who inclination had to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What the condition such a fortress holds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And see on every hand an ample plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full of distress and torment terrible.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sepulchres make all the place uneven;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So likewise did they there on every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saving that there the manner was more bitter;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which they so intensely heated were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That iron more so asks not any art.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All of their coverings uplifted were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from them issued forth such dire laments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, what are all those people</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, having sepulture within those tombs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Here are the Heresiarchs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With their disciples of all sects, and much</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here like together with its like is buried;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more and less the monuments are heated.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when he to the right had turned, we passed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between the torments and high parapets.</span>

					<span>Now onward goes, along a narrow path</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between the torments and the city wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Master, and I follow at his back.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O power supreme, that through these impious circles</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turnest me,” I began, “as pleases thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The people who are lying in these tombs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might they be seen? already are uplifted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The covers all, and no one keepeth guard.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “They all will be closed up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When from Jehoshaphat they shall return</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here with the bodies they have left above.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their cemetery have upon this side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With Epicurus all his followers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with the body mortal make the soul;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in the question thou dost put to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “Good Leader, I but keep concealed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A native of that noble fatherland,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which perhaps I too molestful was.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a sudden issued forth this sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto me he said: “Turn thee; what dost thou?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold there Farinata who has risen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had already fixed mine eyes on his,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he uprose erect with breast and front</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’en as if Hell he had in great despite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exclaiming, “Let thy words explicit be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then asked of me, “Who were thine ancestors?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, who desirous of obeying was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said he: “Fiercely adverse have they been</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me, and to my fathers, and my party;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that two several times I scattered them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If they were banished, they returned on all sides,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I answered him, “the first time and the second;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But yours have not acquired that art aright.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I think that he had risen on his knees.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Round me he gazed, as if solicitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had to see if someone else were with me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But after his suspicion was all spent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping, he said to me: “If through this blind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “I come not of myself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He who is waiting yonder leads me here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His language and the mode of punishment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already unto me had read his name;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On that account my answer was so full.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up starting suddenly, he cried out: “How</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saidst thou⁠—he had? Is he not still alive?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he became aware of some delay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I before my answer made, supine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He fell again, and forth appeared no more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I had remained, did not his aspect change,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And if,” continuing his first discourse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“They have that art,” he said, “not learned aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But fifty times shall not rekindled be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Say why that people is so pitiless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against my race in each one of its laws?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I to him: “The slaughter and great carnage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such orisons in our temple to be made.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After his head he with a sigh had shaken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“There I was not alone,” he said, “nor surely</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without a cause had with the others moved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there I was alone, where everyone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Consented to the laying waste of Florence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He who defended her with open face.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I him entreated, “solve for me that knot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which has entangled my conceptions here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beforehand whatsoe’er time brings with it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the present have another mode.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“We see, like those who have imperfect sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The things,” he said, “that distant are from us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not anything know we of your human state.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will be our knowledge from the moment when</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The portal of the future shall be closed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That still his son is with the living joined.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell him I did it because I was thinking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already of the error you have solved me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now my Master was recalling me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he would tell me who was with him there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said: “With more than a thousand here I lie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within here is the second Frederick,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon he hid himself; and I towards</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He moved along; and afterward thus going,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said to me, “Why art thou so bewildered?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I in his inquiry satisfied him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Let memory preserve what thou hast heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against thyself,” that Sage commanded me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And now attend here;” and he raised his finger.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From her thou’lt know the journey of thy life.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We left the wall, and went towards the middle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along a path that strikes into a valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Upon the margin of a lofty bank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which great rocks broken in a circle made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We came upon a still more cruel throng;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there, by reason of the horrible</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We drew ourselves aside behind the cover</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which said: “Pope Anastasius I hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom out of the right way Photinus drew.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Slow it behoveth our descent to be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the sense be first a little used</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Master thus; and unto him I said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Some compensation find, that the time pass not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Idly;” and he: “Thou seest I think of that.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My son, upon the inside of these rocks,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began he then to say, “are three small circles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all are full of spirits maledict;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Injury is the end; and all such end</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But because fraud is man’s peculiar vice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More it displeases God; and so stand lowest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the first circle of the Violent is;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But since force may be used against three persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In three rounds ’tis divided and constructed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Use force; I say on them and on their things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A death by violence, and painful wounds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Marauders, and freebooters, the first round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tormenteth all in companies diverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Man may lay violent hands upon himself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his own goods; and therefore in the second</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Round must perforce without avail repent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoever of your world deprives himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who games, and dissipates his property,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Violence can be done the Deity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In heart denying and blaspheming Him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for this reason doth the smallest round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A man may practise upon him who trusts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him who doth no confidence imburse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only the bond of love which Nature makes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore within the second circle nestle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Falsification, theft, and simony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the other mode, forgotten is that love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Nature makes, and what is after added,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From which there is a special faith engendered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoe’er betrays forever is consumed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, clear enough proceeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This cavern and the people who possess it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who encounter with such bitter tongues,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore are they inside of the red city</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto me he said: “Why wanders so</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine intellect from that which it is wont?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hast thou no recollection of those words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Incontinence, and Malice, and insane</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bestiality? and how Incontinence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou regardest this conclusion well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to thy mind recallest who they are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That up outside are undergoing penance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They separated are, and why less wroth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Once more a little backward turn thee,” said I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“There where thou sayest that usury offends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Goodness divine, and disengage the knot.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Philosophy,” he said, “to him who heeds it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Noteth, not only in one place alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After what manner Nature takes her course</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Intellect Divine, and from its art;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After not many pages shalt thou find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That this your art as far as possible</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Follows, as the disciple doth the master;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that your art is, as it were, God’s grandchild.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Genesis at the beginning, it behoves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mankind to gain their life and to advance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And since the usurer takes another way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nature herself and in her follower</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But follow, now, as I would fain go on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And far beyond there we descend the crag.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>The place where to descend the bank we came</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as that ruin is which in the flank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either by earthquake or by failing stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For from the mountain’s top, from which it moved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some path ’twould give to him who was above;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even such was the descent of that ravine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on the border of the broken chasm</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The infamy of Crete was stretched along,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when he us beheld, he bit himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as one whom anger racks within.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Sage towards him shouted: “Peradventure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou think’st that here may be the Duke of Athens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who in the world above brought death to thee?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Instructed by thy sister, but he comes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In order to behold your punishments.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which he has received the mortal blow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Minotaur beheld I do the like;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he, the wary, cried: “Run to the passage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While he wroth, ’tis well thou shouldst descend.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus down we took our way o’er that discharge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thoughtful I went; and he said: “Thou art thinking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By that brute anger which just now I quenched.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now will I have thee know, the other time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I here descended to the nether Hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This precipice had not yet fallen down.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But truly, if I well discern, a little</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before His coming who the mighty spoil</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trembled so, that I thought the Universe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The world ofttimes converted into chaos;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at that moment this primeval crag</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The river of blood, within which boiling is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoe’er by violence doth injure others.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That spurs us onward so in our short life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one which all the plain encompasses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Conformable to what my Guide had said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And between this and the embankment’s foot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in the world they used the chase to follow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beholding us descend, each one stood still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from the squadron three detached themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With bows and arrows in advance selected;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from afar one cried: “Unto what torment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Master said: “Our answer will we make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That will of thine was evermore so hasty.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then touched he me, and said: “This one is Nessus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for himself, himself did vengeance take.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thousands and thousands go about the moat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the blood, more than his crime allots.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After he had uncovered his great mouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said to his companions: “Are you ware</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he behind moveth whate’er he touches?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where the two natures are together joined,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Replied: “Indeed he lives, and thus alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Necessity, and not delight, impels us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Someone withdrew from singing Halleluja,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who unto me committed this new office;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by that virtue through which I am moving</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My steps along this savage thoroughfare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give us someone of thine, to be with us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And who may show us where to pass the ford,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who may carry this one on his back;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ’tis no spirit that can walk the air.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said to Nessus: “Turn and do thou guide them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And warn aside, if other band may meet you.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We with our faithful escort onward moved</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>People I saw within up to the eyebrows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the great Centaur said: “Tyrants are these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That forehead there which has the hair so black</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up in the world was by his stepson slain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Now he be first to thee, and second I.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little farther on the Centaur stopped</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above a folk, who far down as the throat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A shade he showed us on one side alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “He cleft asunder in God’s bosom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then people saw I, who from out the river</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lifted their heads and also all the chest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many among these I recognised.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus ever more and more grew shallower</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there across the moat our passage was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Even as thou here upon this side beholdest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Centaur said, “I wish thee to believe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on this other more and more declines</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its bed, until it reunites itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Justice divine, upon this side, is goading</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and forever milks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tears which with the boiling it unseals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who made upon the highways so much war.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.</span>

				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When we had put ourselves within a wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was not marked by any path whatever.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sad announcement of impending doom;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They make laments upon the wondrous trees.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the good Master: “Ere thou enter farther,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Know that thou art within the second round,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus he began to say, “and shalt be, till</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Things that will credence give unto my speech.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And person none beheld I who might make them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think he thought that I perhaps might think</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So many voices issued through those trunks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From people who concealed themselves from us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore the Master said: “If thou break off</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some little spray from any of these trees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the trunk cried, “Why dost thou mangle me?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After it had become embrowned with blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It recommenced its cry: “Why dost thou rend me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even if the souls of serpents we had been.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As out of a green brand, that is on fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At one of the ends, and from the other drips</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hisses with the wind that is escaping;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from that splinter issued forth together</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Had he been able sooner to believe,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Sage made answer, “O thou wounded soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What only in my verses he has seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereas the thing incredible has caused me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To put him to an act which grieveth me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell him who thou wast, so that by way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of some amends thy fame he may refresh</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up in the world, to which he can return.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the trunk said: “So thy sweet words allure me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I a little to discourse am tempted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am the one who both keys had in keeping</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Frederick’s heart, and turned them to and fro</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So softly in unlocking and in locking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That from his secrets most men I withheld;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fidelity I bore the glorious office</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The courtesan who never from the dwelling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Death universal and the vice of courts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inflamed against me all the other minds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My spirit, in disdainful exultation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thinking by dying to escape disdain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made me unjust against myself, the just.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do swear to you that never broke I faith</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the world if one of you return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let him my memory comfort, which is lying</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Waited awhile, and then: “Since he is silent,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Poet said to me, “lose not the time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But speak, and question him, if more may please thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I to him: “Do thou again inquire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Concerning what thou thinks’t will satisfy me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For I cannot, such pity is in my heart.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore he recommenced: “So may the man</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tell us in what way the soul is bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If any from such members e’er is freed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wind was into such a voice converted:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“With brevity shall be replied to you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the exasperated soul abandons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The body whence it rent itself away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It falls into the forest, and no part</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There like a grain of spelt it germinates.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like others for our spoils shall we return;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not that any one may them revest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ’tis not just to have what one casts off.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forest our bodies shall suspended be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each to the thorn of his molested shade.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We were attentive still unto the trunk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When by a tumult we were overtaken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the same way as he is who perceives</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The boar and chase approaching to his stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And two behold! upon our left-hand side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of the forest, every fan they broke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who was in advance: “Now help, Death, help!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was shouting: “Lano, were not so alert</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then, perchance because his breath was failing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He grouped himself together with a bush.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behind them was the forest full of black</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him they lacerated piece by piece,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereafter bore away those aching members.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And led me to the bush, that all in vain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Jacopo,” it said, “of Sant’ Andrea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What helped it thee of me to make a screen?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What blame have I in thy nefarious life?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When near him had the Master stayed his steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said: “Who wast thou, that through wounds so many</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to us: “O souls, that hither come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To look upon the shameful massacre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That has so rent away from me my leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I of that city was which to the Baptist</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forever with his art will make it sad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And were it not that on the pass of Arno</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some glimpses of him are remaining still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the ashes left by Attila,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vain had caused their labour to be done.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of my own house I made myself a gibbet.”</span>

				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Because the charity of my native place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then came we to the confine, where disparted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The second round is from the third, and where</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A horrible form of Justice is beheld.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clearly to manifest these novel things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I say that we arrived upon a plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dolorous forest is a garland to it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All round about, as the sad moat to that;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soil was of an arid and thick sand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not of another fashion made than that</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By each one to be dreaded, who doth read</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which was manifest unto mine eyes!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of naked souls beheld I many herds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who all were weeping very miserably,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And over them seemed set a law diverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And some were sitting all drawn up together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And others went about continually.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those who were going round were far the more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And those were less who lay down to their torment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As of the snow on Alp without a wind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Alexander, in those torrid parts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of India, beheld upon his host</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he provided with his phalanxes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To trample down the soil, because the vapour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Better extinguished was while it was single;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus was descending the eternal heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without repose forever was the dance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of miserable hands, now there, now here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Master,” began I, “thou who overcomest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All things except the demons dire, that issued</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against us at the entrance of the gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the rain seems not to ripen him?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he himself, who had become aware</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I was questioning my Guide about him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried: “Such as I was living, am I, dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if he wearied out by turns the others</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vociferating, ‘Help, good Vulcan, help!’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shot his bolts at me with all his might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then did my Leader speak with such great force,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I had never heard him speak so loud:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not any torment, saving thine own rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would be unto thy fury pain complete.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he turned round to me with better lip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “One of the Seven Kings was he</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, as I said to him, his own despites</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now follow me, and mind thou do not place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But always keep them close unto the wood.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth from the wood a little rivulet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sinful women later share among them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So downward through the sand it went its way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I perceived that there the passage was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In all the rest which I have shown to thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since we have entered in within the gate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose threshold unto no one is denied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So notable as is the present river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which all the little flames above it quenches.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he would give me largess of the food,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which he had given me largess of desire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said he thereafterward, “whose name is Crete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under whose king the world of old was chaste.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is a mountain there, that once was glad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now ’tis deserted, as a thing worn out.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of her own son; and to conceal him better,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whene’er he cried, she there had clamours made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A grand old man stands in the mount erect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who holds his shoulders turned tow’rds Damietta,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His head is fashioned of refined gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of pure silver are the arms and breast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then he is brass as far down as the fork.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From that point downward all is chosen iron,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more he stands on that than on the other.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which gathered together perforate that cavern.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From rock to rock they fall into this valley;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then downward go along this narrow sluice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto that point where is no more descending.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They form Cocytus; what that pool may be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shalt behold, so here ’tis not narrated.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “If so the present runnel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth take its rise in this way from our world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why only on this verge appears it to us?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Thou knowest the place is round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still to the left descending to the bottom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore if something new appear to us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It should not bring amazement to thy face.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I again: “Master, where shall be found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou’rt silent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sayest the other of this rain is made?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied he; “but the boiling of the red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Water might well solve one of them thou makest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the souls repair to lave themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When sin repented of has been removed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said he: “It is time now to abandon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wood; take heed that thou come after me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A way the margins make that are not burning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And over them all vapours are extinguished.”</span>

					<span>Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so the brooklet’s mist o’ershadows it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From fire it saves the water and the dikes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the Flemings, ’twixt Cadsand and Bruges,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fearing the flood that tow’rds them hurls itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as the Paduans along the Brenta,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To guard their villas and their villages,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such similitude had those been made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoever he might be, the master made them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now were we from the forest so remote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I could not have discovered where it was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even if backward I had turned myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we a company of souls encountered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who came beside the dike, and everyone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To eye each other under a new moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so towards us sharpened they their brows</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As an old tailor at the needle’s eye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus scrutinised by such a family,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By someone I was recognised, who seized</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My garment’s hem, and cried out, “What a marvel!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the scorched countenance prevented not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His recognition by my intellect;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bowing down my face unto his own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I made reply, “Are you here, Ser Brunetto?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “May’t not displease thee, O my son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Backward return and let the trail go on.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I said to him: “With all my power I ask it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if you wish me to sit down with you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will, if he please, for I go with him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O son,” he said, “whoever of this herd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And afterward will I rejoin my band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which goes lamenting its eternal doom.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I did not dare to go down from the road</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Level to walk with him; but my head bowed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I held as one who goeth reverently.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he began: “What fortune or what fate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the last day leadeth thee down here?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who is this that showeth thee the way?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Up there above us in the life serene,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I answered him, “I lost me in a valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever yet my age had been completed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This one appeared to me, returning thither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And homeward leadeth me along this road.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “If thou thy star do follow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If well I judged in the life beautiful.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if I had not died so prematurely,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I would have given thee comfort in the work.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that ungrateful and malignant people,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of old time from Fesole descended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A people avaricious, envious, proud;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One party and the other shall be hungry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their litter let the beasts of Fesole</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If any still upon their dunghill rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which may yet revive the consecrated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seed of those Romans, who remained there when</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The nest of such great malice it became.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied I to him, “not yet would you be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In banishment from human nature placed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in my mind is fixed, and touches now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My heart the dear and good paternal image</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of you, when in the world from hour to hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You taught me how a man becomes eternal;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how much I am grateful, while I live</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behoves that in my language be discerned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What you narrate of my career I write,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And keep it to be glossed with other text</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This much will I have manifest to you;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Provided that my conscience do not chide me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Master thereupon on his right cheek</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then said: “He listeneth well who noteth it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor speaking less on that account, I go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His most known and most eminent companions.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “To know of some is well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of others it were laudable to be silent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For short would be the time for so much speech.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And men of letters great and of great fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That one, who by the Servant of the Servants</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More would I say, but coming and discoursing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can be no longer; for that I behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A people comes with whom I may not be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which I still live, and no more I ask.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Across the plain; and seemed to be among them</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one who wins, and not the one who loses.</span>

					<span>Now was I where was heard the reverberation</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of water falling into the next round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to that humming which the beehives make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When shadows three together started forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Running, from out a company that passed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Towards us came they, and each one cried out:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be someone of our depraved city.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It pains me still but to remember it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He turned his face towards me, and “Now wait,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said; “to these we should be courteous.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if it were not for the fire that darts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The nature of this region, I should say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That haste were more becoming thee than them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as we stood still, they recommenced</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The old refrain, and when they overtook us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watching for their advantage and their hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Direct to me, so that in opposite wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His neck and feet continual journey made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, “If the misery of this soft place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began one, “and our aspect black and blistered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let the renown of us thy mind incline</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To tell us who thou art, who thus securely</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Naked and skinless though he now may go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His name was Guidoguerra, and in life</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other, who close by me treads the sand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above there in the world should welcome be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who with them on the cross am placed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could I have been protected from the fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Below I should have thrown myself among them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And think the Teacher would have suffered it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as I should have burned and baked myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My terror overmastered my good will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which made me greedy of embracing them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I began: “Sorrow and not disdain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did your condition fix within me so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That tardily it wholly is stripped off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as this my Lord said unto me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Words, on account of which I thought within me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That people such as you are were approaching.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I of your city am; and evermore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your labours and your honourable names</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I with affection have retraced and heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Promised to me by the veracious Leader;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to the centre first I needs must plunge.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“So may the soul for a long while conduct</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those limbs of thine,” did he make answer then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And so may thy renown shine after thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within our city, as they used to do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or if they wholly have gone out of it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth greatly mortify us with his words.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Florence, so that thou weep’st thereat already!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the three, taking that for my reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If other times so little it doth cost thee,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied they all, “to satisfy another,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When it shall pleasure thee to say, ‘I was,’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See that thou speak of us unto the people.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not an Amen could possibly be said</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So rapidly as they had disappeared;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I followed him, and little had we gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the sound of water was so near us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That speaking we should hardly have been heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as that stream which holdeth its own course</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The first from Monte Veso tow’rds the East,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which is above called Acquacheta, ere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It down descendeth into its low bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at Forli is vacant of that name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reverberates there above San Benedetto</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From Alps, by falling at a single leap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where for a thousand there were room enough;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus downward from a bank precipitate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We found resounding that dark-tinted water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it soon the ear would have offended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had a cord around about me girt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therewithal I whilom had designed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To take the panther with the painted skin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After I this had all from me unloosed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As my Conductor had commanded me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat he turned himself to the right side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at a little distance from the verge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He cast it down into that deep abyss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“It must needs be some novelty respond,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said within myself, “to the new signal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Master with his eye is following so.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah me! how very cautious men should be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With those who not alone behold the act,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said to me: “Soon there will upward come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A man should close his lips as far as may be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because without his fault it causes shame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So may they not be void of lasting favour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw a figure swimming upward come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as he returns who goeth down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.</span>

				<p>
					<span>“Behold the monster with the pointed tail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold him who infecteth all the world.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus unto me my Guide began to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And beckoned him that he should come to shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Near to the confine of the trodden marble;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that uncleanly image of deceit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But on the border did not drag its tail.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The face was as the face of a just man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its semblance outwardly was so benign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of a serpent all the trunk beside.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The back, and breast, and both the sides it had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Depicted o’er with nooses and with shields.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With colours more, groundwork or broidery</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That part are in the water, part on land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as among the guzzling Germans there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beaver plants himself to wage his war;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that vile monster lay upon the border,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His tail was wholly quivering in the void,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Guide said: “Now perforce must turn aside</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our way a little, even to that beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We therefore on the right side descended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made ten steps upon the outer verge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Completely to avoid the sand and flame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after we are come to him, I see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A little farther off upon the sand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A people sitting near the hollow place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said to me the Master: “So that full</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Experience of this round thou bear away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now go and see what their condition is.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There let thy conversation be concise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till thou returnest I will speak with him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus farther still upon the outermost</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Head of that seventh circle all alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I went, where sat the melancholy folk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This way, that way, they helped them with their hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not one of them I knew; but I perceived</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as I gazing round me come among them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had the face and posture of a lion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Proceeding then the current of my sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another of them saw I, red as blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Display a goose more white than butter is.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one, who with an azure sow and gravid</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me: “What dost thou in this moat?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now get thee gone; and since thou’rt still alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Paduan am I with these Florentines;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exclaiming, ‘Come the sovereign cavalier,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;’ ”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fearing lest my longer stay might vex</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him who had warned me not to tarry long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Backward I turned me from those weary souls.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I found my Guide, who had already mounted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the back of that wild animal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said to me: “Now be both strong and bold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now we descend by stairways such as these;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the tail may have no power to harm thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as he is who has so near the ague</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of quartan that his nails are blue already,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And trembles all, but looking at the shade;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even such became I at those proffered words;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But shame in me his menaces produced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which maketh servant strong before good master.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I wished to say, and yet the voice came not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I believed, “Take heed that thou embrace me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he, who other times had rescued me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In other peril, soon as I had mounted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within his arms encircled and sustained me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The circles large, and the descent be little;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Think of the novel burden which thou hast.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when he wholly felt himself afloat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There where his breast had been he turned his tail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that extended like an eel he moved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his paws drew to himself the air.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A greater fear I do not think there was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His father crying, “An ill way thou takest!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than was my own, when I perceived myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sight of everything but of the monster.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By wind upon my face and from below.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard already on the right the whirlpool</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making a horrible crashing under us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw then, for before I had not seen it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The turning and descending, by great horrors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That were approaching upon divers sides.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As falcon who has long been on the wing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, without seeing either lure or bird,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Maketh the falconer say, “Ah me, thou stoopest,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thorough a hundred circles, and alights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And being disencumbered of our persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sped away as arrow from the string.</span>

					<span>There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As is the circle that around it turns.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right in the middle of the field malign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,</span>

					<span>Round, then, is that enclosure which remains</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Just such an image those presented there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as about such strongholds from their gates</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the outer bank are little bridges,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from the precipice’s base did crags</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Project, which intersected dikes and moats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the well that truncates and collects them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within this place, down shaken from the back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Held to the left, and I moved on behind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">New torments, and new wielders of the lash,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This side the middle came they facing us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all upon one side towards the Castle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their faces have, and go unto <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter’s;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On the other side they go towards the Mountain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This side and that, along the livid stone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who cruelly were beating them behind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the first blows! and sooth not any one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The second waited for, nor for the third.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While I was going on, mine eyes by one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Encountered were; and straight I said: “Already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sight of this one I am not unfed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to my going somewhat back assented;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lowering his face, but little it availed him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For said I: “Thou that castest down thine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If false are not the features which thou bearest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Unwillingly I tell it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But forces me thine utterance distinct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which makes me recollect the ancient world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was the one who the fair Ghisola</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Howe’er the shameless story may be told.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nay, rather is this place so full of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That not so many tongues today are taught</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twixt Reno and Savena to say <i>sipa</i>;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While speaking in this manner, with his scourge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A demon smote him, and said: “Get thee gone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pander, there are no women here for coin.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I joined myself again unto mine Escort;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereafterward with footsteps few we came</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To where a crag projected from the bank.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This very easily did we ascend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turning to the right along its ridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From those eternal circles we departed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we were there, where it is hollowed out</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Guide said: “Wait, and see that on thee strike</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The vision of those others evil-born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because together with us they have gone.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the old bridge we looked upon the train</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which tow’rds us came upon the other border,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And which the scourges in like manner smite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the good Master, without my inquiring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said to me: “See that tall one who is coming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still what a royal aspect he retains!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He by the isle of Lemnos passed along</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After the daring women pitiless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had unto death devoted all their males.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There with his tokens and with ornate words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And also for Medea is vengeance done.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him go those who in such wise deceive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this sufficient be of the first valley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To know, and those that in its jaws it holds.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We were already where the narrow path</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that a buttress for another arch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence we heard people, who are making moan</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with their palms beating upon themselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The margins were incrusted with a mould</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By exhalation from below, that sticks there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bottom is so deep, no place suffices</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To give us sight of it, without ascending</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The arch’s back, where most the crag impends.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thither we came, and thence down in the moat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw a people smothered in a filth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That out of human privies seemed to flow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whilst below there with mine eye I search,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He screamed to me: “Wherefore art thou so eager</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To look at me more than the other foul ones?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I to him: “Because, if I remember,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have already seen thee with dry hair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou’rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“The flatteries have submerged me here below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said to me the Guide: “See that thou thrust</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with thine eyes thou well the face attain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thais the harlot is it, who replied</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto her paramour, when he said, ‘Have I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great gratitude from thee?’⁠—‘Nay, marvellous;’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And herewith let our sight be satisfied.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ye who the things of God, which ought to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The brides of holiness, rapaciously</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For silver and for gold do prostitute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We had already on the following tomb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ascended to that portion of the crag</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which o’er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with what justice doth thy power distribute!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw upon the sides and on the bottom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The livid stone with perforations filled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All of one size, and everyone was round.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than those that in my beautiful Saint John</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of which, not many years ago,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I broke for someone, who was drowning in it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be this a seal all men to undeceive.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the mouth of each one there protruded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The feet of a transgressor, and the legs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up to the calf, the rest within remained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all of them the soles were both on fire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To move upon the outer surface only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So likewise was it there from heel to point.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Master, who is that one who writhes himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than his other comrades quivering,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said, “and whom a redder flame is sucking?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “If thou wilt have me bear thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down there along that bank which lowest lies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From him thou’lt know his errors and himself.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We turned, and on the left-hand side descended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the good Master yet from off his haunch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him who so lamented with his shanks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Whoe’er thou art, that standest upside down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To say began I, “if thou canst, speak out.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stood even as the friar who is confessing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he cried out: “Dost thou stand there already,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By many years the record lied to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such I became, as people are who stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not comprehending what is answered them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said Virgilius: “Say to him straightway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">‘I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.’ ”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I replied as was imposed on me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said to me: “Then what wantest thou of me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If who I am thou carest so much to know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Know that I vested was with the great mantle;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And truly was I son of the She-bear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above, and here myself, I pocketed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath my head the others are dragged down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who have preceded me in simony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flattened along the fissure of the rock.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That one shall come who I believed thou wast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time the sudden question I proposed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But longer I my feet already toast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And here have been in this way upside down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For after him shall come of fouler deed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From tow’rds the west a Pastor without law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as befits to cover him and me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>New Jason will he be, of whom we read</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So he who governs France shall be to this one.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not know if I were here too bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That him I answered only in this metre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before he put the keys into his keeping?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Truly he nothing asked but ‘Follow me.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And keep safe guard o’er the ill-gotten money,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And were it not that still forbids it me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The reverence for the keys superlative</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would make use of words more grievous still;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because your avarice afflicts the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When she who sitteth upon many waters</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To fornicate with kings by him was seen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same who with the seven heads was born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And power and strength from the ten horns received,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from the idolater how differ ye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while I sang to him such notes as these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either that anger or that conscience stung him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He struggled violently with both his feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such contented lip he listened ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the sound of the true words expressed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore with both his arms he took me up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when he had me all upon his breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remounted by the way where he descended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But bore me to the summit of the arch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There tenderly he laid his burden down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That would have been hard passage for the goats:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence was unveiled to me another valley.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Of a new pain behoves me to make verses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And give material to the twentieth canto</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the first song, which is of the submerged.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was already thoroughly disposed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To peer down into the uncovered depth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which bathed itself with tears of agony;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And people saw I through the circular valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Silent and weeping, coming at the pace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in this world the Litanies assume.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As lower down my sight descended on them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From chin to the beginning of the chest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For tow’rds the reins the countenance was turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And backward it behoved them to advance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to look forward had been taken from them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perchance indeed by violence of palsy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Someone has been thus wholly turned awry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I ne’er saw it, nor believe it can be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From this thy reading, think now for thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When our own image near me I beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me: “Art thou, too, of the other fools?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here pity lives when it is wholly dead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who is a greater reprobate than he</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who feels compassion at the doom divine?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Opened the earth before the Thebans’ eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore they all cried: ‘Whither rushest thou,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amphiaraus? Why dost leave the war?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And downward ceased he not to fall amain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because he wished to see too far before him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When from a male a female he became,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His members being all of them transformed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And afterwards was forced to strike once more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The two entangled serpents with his rod,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere he could have again his manly plumes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Aruns is, who backs the other’s belly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Carrarese who houses underneath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the marbles white a cavern had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his abode; whence to behold the stars</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sea, the view was not cut off from him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she there, who is covering up her breasts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on that side has all the hairy skin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was Manto, who made quest through many lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Afterwards tarried there where I was born;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof I would thou list to me a little.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After her father had from life departed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She a long season wandered through the world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the Alp’s foot that shuts in Germany</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With water that grows stagnant in that lake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Midway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he of Brescia, and the Veronese</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There of necessity must fall whatever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And grows a river down through verdant pastures.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as the water doth begin to run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not far it runs before it finds a plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And oft ’tis wont in summer to be sickly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Passing that way the virgin pitiless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Land in the middle of the fen descried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untilled and naked of inhabitants;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There to escape all human intercourse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lived, and left her empty body there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The men, thereafter, who were scattered round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Collected in that place, which was made strong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the lagoon it had on every side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They built their city over those dead bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, after her who first the place selected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mantua named it, without other omen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its people once within more crowded were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere the stupidity of Casalodi</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From Pinamonte had received deceit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I caution thee, if e’er thou hearest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Originate my city otherwise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No falsehood may the verity defraud.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, thy discourses are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me so certain, and so take my faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That unto me the rest would be spent coals.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me of the people who are passing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If any one noteworthy thou beholdest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For only unto that my mind reverts.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said he to me: “He who from the cheek</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eryphylus his name was, and so sings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The next, who is so slender in the flanks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was Michael Scott, who of a verity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of magical illusions knew the game.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who now unto his leather and his thread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But come now, for already holds the confines</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yesternight the moon was round already;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From time to time within the forest deep.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.</span>

				<p>
					<span>From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We came along, and held the summit, when</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We halted to behold another fissure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Malebolge and other vain laments;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I beheld it marvellously dark.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in the Arsenal of the Venetians</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To smear their unsound vessels o’er again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sail they cannot; and instead thereof</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was boiling down below there a dense pitch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which upon every side the bank belimed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw it, but I did not see within it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all swell up and resubside compressed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The while below there fixedly I gazed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Leader, crying out: “Beware, beware!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew me unto himself from where I stood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I turned round, as one who is impatient</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see what it behoves him to escape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whom a sudden terror doth unman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I beheld behind us a black devil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Running along upon the crag, approach.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With open wings and light upon his feet!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sinner did encumber with both haunches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From off our bridge, he said: “O Malebranche,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Plunge him beneath, for I return for others</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All there are barrators, except Bonturo;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No into Yes for money there is changed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hurled him down, and over the hard crag</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In so much hurry to pursue a thief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other sank, and rose again face downward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the demons, under cover of the bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried: “Here the Santo Volto has no place!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not uplift thyself above the pitch.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They said: “It here behoves thee to dance covered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Immerse into the middle of the caldron</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said the good Master to me: “That it be not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for no outrage that is done to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be thou afraid, because these things I know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For once before was I in such a scuffle.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he passed on beyond the bridge’s head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Need was for him to have a steadfast front.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the same fury, and the same uproar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who on a sudden begs, where’er he stops,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They issued from beneath the little bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turned against him all their grappling-irons;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he cried out: “Be none of you malignant!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then take counsel as to grappling me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all cried out: “Let Malacoda go;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he came to him, saying: “What avails it?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Advanced into this place,” my Master said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I another show this savage road.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the others said: “Now strike him not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto me my Guide: “O thou, who sittest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Securely now return to me again.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the devils forward thrust themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that I feared they would not keep their compact.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing themselves among so many foes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Close did I press myself with all my person</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From off their countenance, which was not good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They lowered their rakes, and “Wilt thou have me hit him,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They said to one another, “on the rump?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And answered: “Yes; see that thou nick him with it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the same demon who was holding parley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With my Conductor turned him very quickly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said to us: “You can no farther go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forward upon this crag, because is lying</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if it still doth please you to go onward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pursue your way along upon this rock;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Near is another crag that yields a path.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One thousand and two hundred sixty-six</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Years were complete, that here the way was broken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I send in that direction some of mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see if any one doth air himself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began he to cry out, “and thou, Cagnazzo;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let these be safe as far as the next crag,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all unbroken passes o’er the dens.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O me! what is it, Master, that I see?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pray let us go,” I said, “without an escort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou art as observant as thy wont is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with their brows are threatening woe to us?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “I will not have thee fear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because they do it for those boiling wretches.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But first had each one thrust his tongue between</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His teeth towards their leader for a signal;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he had made a trumpet of his rump.</span>

					<span>I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Begin the storming, and their muster make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sometimes starting off for their escape;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O Aretines, and foragers go forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With kettledrums, and signals of the castles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with our own, and with outlandish things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor ship by any sign of land or star.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We went upon our way with the ten demons;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ah, savage company! but in the church</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ever upon the pitch was my intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of the people who therein were burned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To mariners by arching of the back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they should counsel take to save their vessel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One of the sinners would display his back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in less time conceal it than it lightens.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As on the brink of water in a ditch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that they hide their feet and other bulk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So upon every side the sinners stood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But ever as Barbariccia near them came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One frog remains, and down another dives;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I knew, before, the names of all of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So had I noted them when they were chosen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when they called each other, listened how.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Rubicante, see that thou do lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried all together the accursed ones.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, see to it, if thou canst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus come into his adversaries’ hands.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Near to the side of him my Leader drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My mother placed me servant to a lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For she had borne me to a ribald knave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Destroyer of himself and of his things.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I set me there to practise barratry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which I pay the reckoning in this heat.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among malicious cats the mouse had come;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “Stand ye aside, while I enfork him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to my Master he turned round his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ask him again,” he said, “if more thou wish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To know from him, before someone destroy him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Guide: “Now tell then of the other culprits;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under the pitch?” And he: “I separated</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would that I still were covered up with him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For I should fear not either claw nor hook!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Libicocco: “We have borne too much;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down at the legs; whence their Decurion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned round and round about with evil look.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they again somewhat were pacified,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him, who still was looking at his wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Demanded my Conductor without stay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he replied: “It was the Friar Gomita,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dealt so with them each exults thereat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Money he took, and let them smoothly off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he says; and in other offices</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still farther would I speak, but am afraid</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Stand aside there, thou malicious bird.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If you desire either to see or hear,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But let the Malebranche cease a little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that these may not their revenges fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I, down sitting in this very place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For one that I am will make seven come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I shall whistle, as our custom is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To do whenever one of us comes out.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shaking his head, and said: “Just hear the trick</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Responded: “I by far too cunning am,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I procure for mine a greater sadness.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alichin held not in, but running counter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the rest, said to him: “If thou dive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will not follow thee upon the gallop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I will beat my wings above the pitch;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The height be left, and be the bank a shield</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see if thou alone dost countervail us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each to the other side his eyes averted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He first, who most reluctant was to do it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Navarrese selected well his time;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Planted his feet on land, and in a moment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Leaped, and released himself from their design.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he most who was cause of the defeat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore he moved, and cried: “Thou art o’ertakern.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But little it availed, for wings could not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, flying, upward he his breast directed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And upward he returneth cross and weary.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flying behind him followed close, desirous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other should escape, to have a quarrel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the barrator had disappeared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He turned his talons upon his companion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And grappled with him right above the moat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To clapperclaw him well; and both of them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sudden intercessor was the heat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But ne’ertheless of rising there was naught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To such degree they had their wings belimed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made four of them fly to the other side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all their gaffs, and very speedily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This side and that they to their posts descended;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who were already baked within the crust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in this manner busied did we leave them.</span>

					<p epub:type="bridgehead">The Sixth Bolgia: Hypocrites⁠—Catalano and Loderingo⁠—Caiaphas.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Silent, alone, and without company</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We went, the one in front, the other after,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As go the Minor Friars along their way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the fable of Aesop was directed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For <i>mo</i> and <i>issa</i> are not more alike</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than this one is to that, if well we couple</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">End and beginning with a steadfast mind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as one thought from another springs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So afterward from that was born another,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the first fear within me double made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did I ponder: “These on our account</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So great, that much I think it must annoy them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If anger be engrafted on ill-will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They will come after us more merciless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I felt my hair stand all on end already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With terror, and stood backwardly intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When said I: “Master, if thou hidest not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I am in dread; we have them now behind us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I so imagine them, I already feel them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “If I were made of leaded glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine outward image I should not attract</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With similar attitude and similar face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that of both one counsel sole I made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If peradventure the right bank so slope</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That we to the next Bolgia can descend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We shall escape from the imagined chase.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Leader on a sudden seized me up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having more care of him than of herself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that she clothes her only with a shift;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And downward from the top of the hard bank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That one side of the other Bolgia walls.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne’er ran so swiftly water through a sluice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When nearest to the paddles it approaches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As did my Master down along that border,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bearing me with him on his breast away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As his own son, and not as a companion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hardly the bed of the ravine below</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right over us; but he was not afraid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the high Providence, which had ordained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To place them ministers of the fifth moat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The power of thence departing took from all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A painted people there below we found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who went about with footsteps very slow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They had on mantles with the hoods low down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in Cologne they for the monks are made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But inwardly all leaden and so heavy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Frederick used to put them on of straw.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Again we turned us, still to the left hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But owing to the weight, that weary folk</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came on so tardily, that we were new</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In company at each motion of the haunch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I unto my Leader: “See thou find</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Someone who may by deed or name be known,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thus in going move thine eye about.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried to us from behind: “Stay ye your feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps thou’lt have from me what thou demandest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: “Wait,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then according to his pace proceed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they came up, long with an eye askance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They scanned me without uttering a word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to each other turned, and said together:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“He by the action of his throat seems living;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if they dead are, by what privilege</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said to me: “Tuscan, who to the college</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of miserable hypocrites art come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not disdain to tell us who thou art.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to them: “Born was I, and grew up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the great town on the fair river of Arno,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the body am I’ve always had.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But who are ye, in whom there trickles down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one replied to me: “These orange cloaks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cause in this way their balances to creak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I Catalano, and he Loderingo</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Named, and together taken by thy city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the wont is to take one man alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For maintenance of its peace; and we were such</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That still it is apparent round Gardingo.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Friars,” began I, “your iniquitous …”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One crucified with three stakes on the ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blowing into his beard with suspirations;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said to me: “This transfixed one, whom thou seest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To put one man to torture for the people.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crosswise and naked is he on the path,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in like mode his father-in-law is punished</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within this moat, and the others of the council,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which for the Jews was a malignant seed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er him who was extended on the cross</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So vilely in eternal banishment.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he directed to the Friar this voice:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If to the right hand any pass slope down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By which we two may issue forth from here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without constraining some of the black angels</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To come and extricate us from this deep.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he made answer: “Nearer than thou hopest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There is a rock, that forth from the great circle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save that at this ’tis broken, and does not bridge it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">You will be able to mount up the ruin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then said: “The business badly he recounted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Friar: “Many of the Devil’s vices</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he’s a liar and the father of lies.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence from the heavy-laden I departed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the prints of his beloved feet.</span>

				</header>
				<p>
					<span>In that part of the youthful year wherein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now the nights draw near to half the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What time the hoarfrost copies on the ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The outward semblance of her sister white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But little lasts the temper of her pen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Returns in doors, and up and down laments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then he returns and hope revives again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeing the world has changed its countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In little time, and takes his shepherd’s crook,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For as we came unto the ruined bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Leader turned to me with that sweet look</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which at the mountain’s foot I first beheld.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His arms he opened, after some advisement</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within himself elected, looking first</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as he who acts and meditates,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So upward lifting me towards the summit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “To that one grapple afterwards,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But try first if ’tis such that it will hold thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were able to ascend from jag to jag.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had it not been, that upon that precinct</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shorter was the ascent than on the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He I know not, but I had been dead beat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But because Malebolge tow’rds the mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the profoundest well is all inclining,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The structure of each valley doth import</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That one bank rises and the other sinks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still we arrived at length upon the point</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The breath was from my lungs so milked away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I was up, that I could go no farther,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Master said; “for sitting upon down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withouten which whoso his life consumes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As smoke in air or in the water foam.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore raise thee up, o’ercome the anguish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With spirit that o’ercometh every battle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If with its heavy body it sink not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis not enough from these to have departed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let it avail thee, if thou understand me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I uprose, showing myself provided</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Better with breath than I did feel myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “Go on, for I am strong and bold.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upward we took our way along the crag,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more precipitous far than that before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not well adapted to articulate words.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know not what it said, though o’er the back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I now was of the arch that passes there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was bent downward, but my living eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore I: “Master, see that thou arrive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the next round, and let us descend the wall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For as from hence I hear and understand not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So I look down and nothing I distinguish.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Other response,” he said, “I make thee not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Except the doing; for the modest asking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ought to be followed by the deed in silence.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We from the bridge descended at its head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I beheld therein a terrible throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the remembrance still congeals my blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neither so many plagues nor so malignant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’er showed she with all Ethiopia,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among this cruel and most dismal throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">People were running naked and affrighted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These riveted upon their reins the tail</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And head, and were in front of them entwined.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! at one who was upon our side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ‘O’ so quickly e’er, nor ‘I’ was written,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behoved it that in falling he became.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ashes drew together, and of themselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into himself they instantly returned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus by the great sages ’tis confessed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The phoenix dies, and then is born again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When it approaches its five-hundredth year;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But only on tears of incense and amomum,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he is who falls, and knows not how,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By force of demons who to earth down drag him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or other oppilation that binds man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he arises and around him looks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such was that sinner after he had risen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Justice of God! O how severe it is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence he replied: “I rained from Tuscany</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A short time since into this cruel gorge.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as the mule I was; I’m Vanni Fucci,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I unto the Guide: “Tell him to stir not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ask what crime has thrust him here below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But unto me directed mind and face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with a melancholy shame was painted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said: “It pains me more that thou hast caught me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amid this misery where thou seest me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than when I from the other life was taken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What thou demandest I cannot deny;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So low am I put down because I robbed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sacristy of the fair ornaments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And falsely once ’twas laid upon another;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou shalt e’er be out of the dark places,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with impetuous and bitter tempest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this I’ve said that it may give thee pain.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>At the conclusion of his words, the thief</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying: “Take that, God, for at thee I aim them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From that time forth the serpents were my friends;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For one entwined itself about his neck</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if it said: “I will not thou speak more;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And round his arms another, and rebound him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Clinching itself together so in front,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with them he could not a motion make.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spirit I saw not against God so proud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He fled away, and spake no further word;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I beheld a Centaur full of rage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come crying out: “Where is, where is the scoffer?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think Maremma has so many</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Serpents as he had all along his back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far as where our countenance begins.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With wings wide open was a dragon lying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he sets fire to all that he encounters.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Master said: “That one is Cacus, who</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Created oftentimes a lake of blood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He goes not on the same road with his brothers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason of the fraudulent theft he made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the great herd, which he had near to him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mace of Hercules, who peradventure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spirits three had underneath us come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until what time they shouted: “Who are you?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which account our story made a halt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then we were intent on them alone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I did not know them; but it came to pass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it is wont to happen by some chance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That one to name the other was compelled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exclaiming: “Where can Cianfa have remained?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What I shall say, it will no marvel be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For I who saw it hardly can admit it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I was holding raised on them my brows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the forward ones his arms it seized;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And put its tail through in between the two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And up behind along the reins outspread it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ivy was never fastened by its barbs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the other’s limbs entwined its own.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They had been made, and intermixed their colour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en as proceedeth on before the flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upward along the paper a brown colour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other two looked on, and each of them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried out: “O me, Agnello, how thou changest!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold, thou now art neither two nor one.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already the two heads had one become,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When there appeared to us two figures mingled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into one face, wherein the two were lost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Members became that never yet were seen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every original aspect there was cancelled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two and yet none did the perverted image</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appear, and such departed with slow pace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as a lizard, under the great scourge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Livid and black as is a peppercorn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in that part whereat is first received</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then downward fell in front of him extended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One through the wound, the other through the mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For if him to a snake, her to fountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because two natures never front to front</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has he transmuted, so that both the forms</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To interchange their matter ready were.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Together they responded in such wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke the wounded drew his feet together.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The legs together with the thighs themselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Adhered so, that in little time the juncture</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No sign whatever made that was apparent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He with the cloven tail assumed the figure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other one was losing, and his skin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became elastic, and the other’s hard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both feet of the reptile, that were short,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lengthen as much as those contracted were.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became the member that a man conceals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of his own the wretch had two created.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While both of them the exhalation veils</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a new colour, and engenders hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On one of them and depilates the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one uprose and down the other fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though turning not away their impious lamps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who was standing drew it tow’rds the temples,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from excess of matter, which came thither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What did not backward run and was retained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that excess made to the face a nose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the lips thickened far as was befitting.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And backward draws the ears into his head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the same manner as the snail its horns;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so the tongue, which was entire and apt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the valley hissing takes to flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after him the other speaking sputters.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said to the other: “I’ll have Buoso run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crawling as I have done, along this road.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this way I beheld the seventh ballast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They could not flee away so secretly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he it was who sole of three companions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which came in the beginning, was not changed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the thieves five citizens of thine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou thereby to no great honour risest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if when morn is near our dreams are true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Feel shalt thou in a little time from now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if it now were, it were not too soon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ’twill aggrieve me more the more I age.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We went our way, and up along the stairs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The bourns had made us to descend before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remounted my Conductor and drew me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And following the solitary path</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The foot without the hand sped not at all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I direct my mind to what I saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more my genius curb than I am wont,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it may run not unless virtue guide it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that if some good star, or better thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As many as the hind (who on the hill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rests at the time when he who lights the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His countenance keeps least concealed from us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeth the glowworms down along the valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With flames as manifold resplendent all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As soon as I was where the depth appeared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such as he who with the bears avenged him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld Elijah’s chariot at departing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For with his eye he could not follow it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So as to see aught else than flame alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a little cloud ascending upward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every flame a sinner steals away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that, if I had seized not on a rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down had I fallen without being pushed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exclaimed: “Within the fires the spirits are;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My Master,” I replied, “by hearing thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I am more sure; but I surmised already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It might be so, and already wished to ask thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At top, it seems uprising from the pyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where was Eteocles with his brother placed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He answered me: “Within there are tormented</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there within their flame do they lament</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ambush of the horse, which made the door</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence issued forth the Romans’ gentle seed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deidamia still deplores Achilles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pain for the Palladium there is borne.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If they within those sparks possess the power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To speak,” I said, “thee, Master, much I pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thou make no denial of awaiting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the horned flame shall hither come;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Worthy is thy entreaty</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leave me to speak, because I have conceived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which thou wishest; for they might disdain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When now the flame had come unto that point,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After this fashion did I hear him speak:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O ye, who are twofold within one fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I deserved of you, while I was living,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I deserved of you or much or little</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not move on, but one of you declare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whither, being lost, he went away to die.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then of the antique flame the greater horn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Murmuring, began to wave itself about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafterward, the summit to and fro</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It uttered forth a voice, and said: “When I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Circe had departed, who concealed me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than a year there near unto Gaeta,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For my old father, nor the due affection</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which joyous should have made Penelope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could overcome within me the desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I had to be experienced of the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of the vice and virtue of mankind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I put forth on the high open sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With one sole ship, and that small company</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which I never had deserted been.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the others which that sea bathes round about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I and my company were old and slow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When at that narrow passage we arrived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That man no farther onward should adventure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On the right hand behind me left I Seville,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on the other already had left Ceuta.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perils,’ I said, ‘have come unto the West,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To this so inconsiderable vigil</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which is remaining of your senses still</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So eager did I render my companions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That then I hardly could have held them back.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And having turned our stern unto the morning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Evermore gaining on the larboard side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already all the stars of the other pole</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The night beheld, and ours so very low</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It did not rise above the ocean floor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Five times rekindled and as many quenched</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had been the splendour underneath the moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since we had entered into the deep pass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When there appeared to us a mountain, dim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From distance, and it seemed to me so high</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I had never any one beheld.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And smote upon the fore part of the ship.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until the sea above us closed again.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>Already was the flame erect and quiet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To speak no more, and now departed from us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the permission of the gentle Poet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When yet another, which behind it came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a confused sound that issued from it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the lament of him, and that was right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with his file had modulated it)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still it appeared with agony transfixed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus, by not having any way or issue</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At first from out the fire, to its own language</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Converted were the melancholy words.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But afterwards, when they had gathered way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up through the point, giving it that vibration</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The tongue had given them in their passage out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We heard it said: “O thou, at whom I aim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying, ‘Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because I come perchance a little late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou but lately into this blind world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For I was from the mountains there between</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I still was downward bent and listening,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When my Conductor touched me on the side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “Speak thou: this one a Latian is.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who had beforehand my reply</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In readiness, forthwith began to speak:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“O soul, that down below there art concealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Romagna thine is not and never has been</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But open war I none have left there now.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that she covers Cervia with her vans.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The city which once made the long resistance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of the French a sanguinary heap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Verrucchio’s ancient Mastiff and the new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cities of Lamone and Santerno</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who changes sides ’twixt summertime and winter;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lives between tyranny and a free state.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So may thy name hold front there in the world.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the fire a little more had roared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If I believed that my reply were made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To one who to the world would e’er return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This flame without more flickering would stand still;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But inasmuch as never from this depth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did any one return, if I hear true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without the fear of infamy I answer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Believing thus begirt to make amends;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And truly my belief had been fulfilled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who put me back into my former sins;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While I was still the form of bone and pulp</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My mother gave to me, the deeds I did</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were not those of a lion, but a fox.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The machinations and the covert ways</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I knew them all, and practised so their craft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When now unto that portion of mine age</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw myself arrived, when each one ought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That which before had pleased me then displeased me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And penitent and confessing I surrendered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Leader of the modern Pharisees</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having a war near unto Lateran,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For each one of his enemies was Christian,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And none of them had been to conquer Acre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor merchandising in the Sultan’s land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In him regarded, nor in me that cord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So this one sought me out as an adept</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To cure him of the fever of his pride.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because his words appeared inebriate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then he said: ‘Be not thy heart afraid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How to raze Palestrina to the ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which my predecessor held not dear.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then urged me on his weighty arguments</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There, where my silence was the worst advice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said I: ‘Father, since thou washest me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that sin into which I now must fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The promise long with the fulfilment short</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Francis came afterward, when I was dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For me; but one of the black Cherubim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said to him: ‘Take him not; do me no wrong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He must come down among my servitors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because he gave the fraudulent advice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From which time forth I have been at his hair;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For who repents not cannot be absolved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor can one both repent and will at once,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because of the contradiction which consents not.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O miserable me! how I did shudder</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he seized on me, saying: ‘Peradventure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou didst not think that I was a logician!’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He bore me unto Minos, who entwined</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after he had bitten it in great rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said: ‘Of the thievish fire a culprit this;’</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And vested thus in going I bemoan me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When it had thus completed its recital,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The flame departed uttering lamentations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up o’er the crag above another arch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Who ever could, e’en with untrammelled words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which now I saw, by many times narrating?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each tongue would for a certainty fall short</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason of our speech and memory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That have small room to comprehend so much.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If were again assembled all the people</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which formerly upon the fateful land</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shed by the Romans and the lingering war</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Livy has recorded, who errs not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With those who felt the agony of blows</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At Ceperano, where a renegade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where without arms the old Alardo conquered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should show, it would be nothing to compare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A cask by losing centrepiece or cant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was never shattered so, as I saw one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His heart was visible, and the dismal sack</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That maketh excrement of what is eaten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While I was all absorbed in seeing him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He looked at me, and opened with his hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His bosom, saying: “See now how I rend me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In front of me doth Ali weeping go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the others whom thou here beholdest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disseminators of scandal and of schism</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus cruelly, unto the falchion’s edge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Putting again each one of all this ream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we have gone around the doleful road;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason that our wounds are closed again</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere any one in front of him repass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But who art thou, that musest on the crag,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance to postpone going to the pain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is adjudged upon thine accusations?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Master made reply, “to be tormented;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to procure him full experience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this is true as that I speak to thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than a hundred were there when they heard him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who in the moat stood still to look at me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If soon he wish not here to follow me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So with provisions, that no stress of snow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May give the victory to the Novarese,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which otherwise to gain would not be easy.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After one foot to go away he lifted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This word did Mahomet say unto me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another one, who had his throat pierced through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And nose cut off close underneath the brows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And had no longer but a single ear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Staying to look in wonder with the others,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the others did his gullet open,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which outwardly was red in every part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whom I once saw up in Latian land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless too great similitude deceive me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If e’er thou see again the lovely plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make it known to the best two of Fano,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That if foreseeing here be not in vain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cast over from their vessel shall they be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drowned near unto the Cattolica,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Neptune ne’er yet beheld so great a crime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That traitor, who sees only with one eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And holds the land, which someone here with me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would fain be fasting from the vision of,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will make them come unto a parley with him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then will do so, that to Focara’s wind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They will not stand in need of vow or prayer.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “Show to me and declare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who is this person of the bitter vision.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of one of his companions, and his mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oped, crying: “This is he, and he speaks not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one, being banished, every doubt submerged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Caesar by affirming the forearmed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Always with detriment allowed delay.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O how bewildered unto me appeared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Curio, who in speaking was so bold!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one, who both his hands dissevered had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The stumps uplifting through the murky air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the blood made horrible his face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cried out: “Thou shalt remember Mosca also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who said, alas! ‘A thing done has an end!’</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And death unto thy race,” thereto I added;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Departed, like a person sad and crazed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I remained to look upon the crowd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw a thing which I should be afraid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without some further proof, even to recount,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If it were not that conscience reassures me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That good companion which emboldens man</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A trunk without a head walk in like manner</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As walked the others of the mournful herd.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the hair it held the head dissevered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that upon us gazed and said: “O me!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It of itself made to itself a lamp,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they were two in one, and one in two;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When it was come close to the bridge’s foot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It lifted high its arm with all the head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bring more closely unto us its words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which were: “Behold now the sore penalty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold if any be as great as this.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so that thou may carry news of me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I made the father and the son rebellious;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Achitophel not more with Absalom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And David did with his accursed goadings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because I parted persons so united,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From its beginning, which is in this trunk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus is observed in me the counterpoise.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>The many people and the divers wounds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These eyes of mine had so inebriated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they were wishful to stand still and weep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But said Virgilius: “What dost thou still gaze at?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why is thy sight still riveted down there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the mournful, mutilated shades?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Consider, if to count them thou believest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now the moon is underneath our feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more is to be seen than what thou seest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If thou hadst,” I made answer thereupon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Attended to the cause for which I looked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I went, already making my reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And superadding: “In that cavern where</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I think a spirit of my blood laments</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sin which down below there costs so much.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said the Master: “Be no longer broken</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy thought from this time forward upon him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For him I saw below the little bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wholly at that time wast thou impeded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By him who formerly held Altaforte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou didst not look that way; so he departed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O my Conductor, his own violent death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is not yet avenged for him,” I said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“By any who is sharer in the shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made him disdainful; whence he went away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I imagine, without speaking to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thereby made me pity him the more.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did we speak as far as the first place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the crag, which the next valley shows</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down to the bottom, if there were more light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we were now right over the last cloister</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could manifest themselves unto our sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What pain would be, if from the hospitals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Valdichiana, ’twixt July and September,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of Maremma and Sardinia</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the diseases in one moat were gathered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such was it here, and such a stench came from it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We had descended on the furthest bank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the long crag, upon the left hand still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then more vivid was my power of sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down tow’rds the bottom, where the ministress</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Punishes forgers, which she here records.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think a sadder sight to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was in Aegina the whole people sick,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(When was the air so full of pestilence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The animals, down to the little worm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According as the poets have affirmed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were from the seed of ants restored again,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than was it to behold through that dark valley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The spirits languishing in divers heaps.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This on the belly, that upon the back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One of the other lay, and others crawling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shifted themselves along the dismal road.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We step by step went onward without speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gazing upon and listening to the sick</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw two sitting leaned against each other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As leans in heating platter against platter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From head to foot bespotted o’er with scabs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And never saw I plied a currycomb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By stableboy for whom his master waits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As everyone was plying fast the bite</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of nails upon himself, for the great rage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of itching which no other succour had.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or any other fish that has them largest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began my Leader unto one of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And makest of them pincers now and then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me if any Latian is with those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To all eternity unto this work.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of us here,” one weeping made reply;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“But who art thou, that questionest about us?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said the Guide: “One am I who descends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I intend to show Hell unto him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then broken was their mutual support,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And trembling each one turned himself to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With others who had heard him by rebound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wholly to me did the good Master gather,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “Say unto them whate’er thou wishest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I began, since he would have it so:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“So may your memory not steal away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the first world from out the minds of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But so may it survive ’neath many suns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say to me who ye are, and of what people;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let not your foul and loathsome punishment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make you afraid to show yourselves to me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I of Arezzo was,” one made reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And Albert of Siena had me burned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But what I died for does not bring me here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I could rise by flight into the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he who had conceit, but little wit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would have me show to him the art; and only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because no Daedalus I made him, made me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be burned by one who held him as his son.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For alchemy, which in the world I practised,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the Poet said I: “Now was ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So vain a people as the Sienese?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not for a certainty the French by far.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied unto my speech: “Taking out Stricca,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who knew the art of moderate expenses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Niccolo, who the luxurious use</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of cloves discovered earliest of all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within that garden where such seed takes root;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And taking out the band, among whom squandered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caccia d’Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, that thou know who thus doth second thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tow’rds me, so that my face well answer thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou shalt see I am Capocchio’s shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who metals falsified by alchemy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How I a skilful ape of nature was.”</span>

					<span>’Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Semele, against the Theban blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As she already more than once had shown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So reft of reason Athamas became,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, seeing his own wife with children twain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Walking encumbered upon either hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He cried: “Spread out the nets, that I may take</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then extended his unpitying claws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And she, with the other burden, drowned herself;⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the time when fortune downward hurled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Trojan’s arrogance, that all things dared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of her Polydorus on the shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of her senses like a dog she barked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much the anguish had her mind distorted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were ever seen in any one so cruel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In goading beasts, and much more human members,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, biting, in the manner ran along</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One to Capocchio came, and by the nape</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It made his belly grate the solid bottom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said to me: “That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And raving goes thus harrying other people.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O,” said I to him, “so may not the other</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “That is the ancient ghost</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond all rightful love her father’s lover.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She came to sin with him after this manner,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By counterfeiting of another’s form;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he who goeth yonder undertook,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he might gain the lady of the herd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making a will and giving it due form.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after the two maniacs had passed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To look upon the other evil-born.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw one made in fashion of a lute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If he had only had the groin cut off</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Just at the point at which a man is forked.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the face corresponds not to the belly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Compelled him so to hold his lips apart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As does the hectic, who because of thirst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One tow’rds the chin, the other upward turns.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O ye, who without any torment are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And why I know not, in the world of woe,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said to us, “behold, and be attentive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the misery of Master Adam;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I had while living much of what I wished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now, alas! a drop of water crave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rivulets, that from the verdant hills</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making their channels to be cold and moist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ever before me stand, and not in vain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For far more doth their image dry me up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rigid justice that chastises me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Draweth occasion from the place in which</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is Romena, where I counterfeited</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The currency imprinted with the Baptist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which I left my body burned above.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if I here could see the tristful soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Branda’s fount I would not give the sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One is within already, if the raving</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shades that are going round about speak truth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I were only still so light, that in</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A hundred years I could advance one inch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I had already started on the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeking him out among this squalid folk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Although the circuit be eleven miles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And be not less than half a mile across.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For them am I in such a family;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They did induce me into coining florins,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had three carats of impurity.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “Who are the two poor wretches</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I found them here,” replied he, “when I rained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor do I think they will for evermore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One the false woman is who accused Joseph,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From acute fever they send forth such reek.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of them, who felt himself annoyed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At being, peradventure, named so darkly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Master Adam smote him in the face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With arm that did not seem to be less hard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saying to him: “Although be taken from me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I have an arm unfettered for such need.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat he answer made: “When thou didst go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dropsical: “Thou sayest true in that;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But thou wast not so true a witness there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said Sinon; “and for one fault I am here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou for more than any other demon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Remember, perjurer, about the horse,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He made reply who had the swollen belly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy tongue,” the Greek said, “and the putrid water</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the false-coiner: “So is gaping wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy mouth for speaking evil, as ’tis wont;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In listening to them was I wholly fixed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When said the Master to me: “Now just look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For little wants it that I quarrel with thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When him I heard in anger speak to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I turned me round towards him with such shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That still it eddies through my memory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he is who dreams of his own harm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he craves what is, as if it were not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such I became, not having power to speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to excuse myself I wished, and still</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Excused myself, and did not think I did it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Master said, “than this of thine has been;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make account that I am aye beside thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If e’er it come to pass that fortune bring thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where there are people in a like dispute;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For a base wish it is to wish to hear it.”</span>

					<p epub:type="bridgehead">The Giants, Nimrod, Ephialtes, and Antaeus.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then held out to me the medicine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus do I hear that once Achilles’ spear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His and his father’s, used to be the cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First of a sad and then a gracious boon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the bank that girds it round about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Going across it without any speech.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There it was less than night, and less than day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that my sight went little in advance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So loud it would have made each thunder faint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, counter to it following its way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the dolorous discomfiture</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So terribly Orlando sounded not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Short while my head turned thitherward I held</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When many lofty towers I seemed to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat I: “Master, say, what town is this?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Because thou peerest forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How much the sense deceives itself by distance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore a little faster spur thee on.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then tenderly he took me by the hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “Before we farther have advanced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the reality may seem to thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they are in the well, around the bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From navel downward, one and all of them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As, when the fog is vanishing away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Little by little doth the sight refigure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whate’er the mist that crowds the air conceals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More and more near approaching tow’rd the verge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My error fled, and fear came over me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because as on its circular parapets</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Montereggione crowns itself with towers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’en thus the margin which surrounds the well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With one half of their bodies turreted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’en now from out the heavens when he thunders.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I of one already saw the face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And down along his sides both of the arms.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certainly Nature, when she left the making</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of animals like these, did well indeed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By taking such executors from Mars;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if of elephants and whales she doth not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More just and more discreet will hold her for it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For where the argument of intellect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is added unto evil will and power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No rampart can the people make against it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His face appeared to me as long and large</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter’s,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in proportion were the other bones;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that the margin, which an apron was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down from the middle, showed so much of him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above it, that to reach up to his hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For I beheld thirty great palms of him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Raphael mai amech izabi almi,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto him my Guide: “Soul idiotic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When wrath or other passion touches thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said to me: “He doth himself accuse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One language in the world is not still used.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For even such to him is every language</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As his to others, which to none is known.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore a longer journey did we make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We found another far more fierce and large.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In binding him, who might the master be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I cannot say; but he had pinioned close</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind the right arm, and in front the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With chains, that held him so begirt about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the neck down, that on the part uncovered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“This proud one wished to make experiment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Leader said, “whence he has such a guerdon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time the giants terrified the gods;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The arms he wielded never more he moves.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “If possible, I should wish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of the measureless Briareus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These eyes of mine might have experience.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he replied: “Thou shalt behold Antaeus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There never was an earthquake of such might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it could shake a tower so violently,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then was I more afraid of death than ever,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For nothing more was needful than the fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I had not beheld the manacles.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then we proceeded farther in advance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou, who in the valley fortunate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Scipio the heir of glory made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Once brought’st a thousand lions for thy prey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among thy brothers, some it seems still think</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This one can give of that which here is longed for;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still in the world can he restore thy fame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because he lives, and still expects long life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If to itself Grace call him not untimely.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So said the Master; and in haste the other</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His hands extended and took up my Guide⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me: “Draw nigh, that I may take thee;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then of himself and me one bundle made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As seems the Carisenda, to behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above it so that opposite it hangs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watching to see him stoop, and then it was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I could have wished to go some other way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.</span>

					<span>If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As were appropriate to the dismal hole</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would press out the juice of my conception</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More fully; but because I have them not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not without fear I bring myself to speak;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ’tis no enterprise to take in jest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To sketch the bottom of all the universe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from the fact the word be not diverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O rabble ill-begotten above all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who’re in the place to speak of which is hard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we were down within the darksome well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the giant’s feet, but lower far,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I was scanning still the lofty wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard it said to me: “Look how thou steppest!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And underfoot a lake, that from the frost</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The semblance had of glass, and not of water.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So thick a veil ne’er made upon its current</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In wintertime Danube in Austria,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As there was here; so that if Tambernich</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’en at the edge ’twould not have given a creak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as to croak the frog doth place himself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With muzzle out of water⁠—when is dreaming</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Livid, as far down as where shame appears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each one his countenance held downward bent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among them witness of itself procures.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When round about me somewhat I had looked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I downward turned me, and saw two so close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hair upon their heads together mingled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said, “who are you;” and they bent their necks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when to me their faces they had lifted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their eyes, which first were only moist within,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gushed o’er the eyelids, and the frost congealed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The tears between, and locked them up again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clamp never bound together wood with wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Butted together, so much wrath o’ercame them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one, who had by reason of the cold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou desire to know who these two are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The valley whence Bisenzio descends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Belonged to them and to their father Albert.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They from one body came, and all Caina</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At one and the same blow by Arthur’s hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So with his head I see no farther forward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that thou put me not to further speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Know that I Camicion de’ Pazzi was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wait Carlino to exonerate me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I beheld a thousand faces, made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Purple with cold; whence o’er me comes a shudder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while we were advancing tow’rds the middle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where everything of weight unites together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I was shivering in the eternal shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether ’twere will, or destiny, or chance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I know not; but in walking ’mong the heads</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I struck my foot hard in the face of one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping he growled: “Why dost thou trample me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, now wait here for me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I through him may issue from a doubt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Leader stopped; and to that one I said</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who was blaspheming vehemently still:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smiting,” replied he, “other people’s cheeks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that, if thou wert living, ’twere too much?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was my response, “if thou demandest fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ’mid the other notes thy name I place.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “For the reverse I long;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “It must needs be thou name thyself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or not a hair remain upon thee here.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he to me: “Though thou strip off my hair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If on my head a thousand times thou fall.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had his hair in hand already twisted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more than one shock of it had pulled out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When cried another: “What doth ail thee, Bocca?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is’t not enough to clatter with thy jaws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now,” said I, “I care not to have thee speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will report of thee veracious news.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Begone,” replied he, “and tell what thou wilt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But be not silent, if thou issue hence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He weepeth here the silver of the French;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">‘I saw,’ thus canst thou phrase it, ‘him of Duera</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the sinners stand out in the cold.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who oped Faenza when the people slep.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already we had gone away from him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I beheld two frozen in one hole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that one head a hood was to the other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as bread through hunger is devoured,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The uppermost on the other set his teeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the brain is to the nape united.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The temples of Menalippus in disdain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than that one did the skull and the other things.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou, who showest by such bestial sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell me the wherefore,” said I, “with this compact,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That if thou rightfully of him complain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I in the world above repay thee for it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that wherewith I speak be not dried up.”</span>

					<span>His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sinner, wiping it upon the hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the same head that he behind had wasted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he began: “Thou wilt that I renew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To think of only, ere I speak of it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if my words be seed that may bear fruit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,</span>

					<span class="i1">Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know not who thou art, nor by what mode</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trusting in him I was made prisoner,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after put to death, I need not say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ne’ertheless what thou canst not have heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is to say, how cruel was my death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A narrow perforation in the mew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which bears because of me the title of Famine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in which others still must be locked up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had shown me through its opening many moons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already, when I dreamed the evil dream</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of the future rent for me the veil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one appeared to me as lord and master,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sleuthhounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had sent out before him to the front.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After brief course seemed unto me forespent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I before the morrow was awake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with me were, and asking after bread.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And weep’st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At which our food used to be brought to us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And through his dream was each one apprehensive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I heard locking up the under door</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I gazed into the faces of my sons.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wept not, I within so turned to stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They wept; and darling little Anselm mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: ‘Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until another sun rose on the world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As now a little glimmer made its way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the dolorous prison, and I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon four faces my own very aspect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of my hands in agony I bit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, thinking that I did it from desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said they: ‘Father, much less pain ’twill give us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That day we all were silent, and the next.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying, ‘My father, why dost thou not help me?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there he died; and, as thou seest me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw the three fall, one by one, between</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already blind, to groping over each,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And three days called them after they were dead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then hunger did what sorrow could not do.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, as a dog’s, upon the bone were strong.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the fair land there where the ‘Si’ doth sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That every person in thee it may drown!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if Count Ugolino had the fame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the other two my song doth name above!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We passed still farther onward, where the ice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another people ruggedly enswathes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping itself there does not let them weep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because the earliest tears a cluster form,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, in the manner of a crystal visor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because of cold all sensibility</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its station had abandoned in my face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I: “My Master, who sets this in motion?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is not below here every vapour quenched?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he to me: “Full soon shalt thou be where</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of the wretches of the frozen crust</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried out to us: “O souls so merciless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the last post is given unto you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A little, e’er the weeping recongeal.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I to him: “If thou wouldst have me help thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May I go to the bottom of the ice.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he replied: “I am Friar Alberigo;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who here a date am getting for my fig.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O,” said I to him, “now art thou, too, dead?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he to me: “How may my body fare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That oftentimes the soul descendeth here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, that thou mayest more willingly remove</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From off my countenance these glassy tears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Know that as soon as any soul betrays</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have done, his body by a demon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until his time has wholly been revolved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Itself down rushes into such a cistern;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And still perchance above appears the body</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It is Ser Branca d’ Oria, and many years</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have passed away since he was thus locked up.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I think,” said I to him, “thou dost deceive me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Branca d’ Oria is not dead as yet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In moat above,” said he, “of Malebranche,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When this one left a devil in his stead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In his own body and one near of kin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who made together with him the betrayal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Open mine eyes;”⁠—and open them I did not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to be rude to him was courtesy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With every virtue, full of every vice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For with the vilest spirit of Romagna</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I found of you one such, who for his deeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In soul already in Cocytus bathes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And still above in body seems alive!</span>

					<span class="i1">Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,”</span>

					<span class="i1">My Master said, “if thou discernest him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our hemisphere is darkening into night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,</span>

					<span>Methought that such a building then I saw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, for the wind, I drew myself behind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Guide, because there was no other shelter.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the shades were wholly covered up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some prone are lying, others stand erect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This with the head, and that one with the soles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When in advance so far we had proceeded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it my Master pleased to show to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He from before me moved and made me stop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “Behold Dis, and behold the place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How frozen I became and powerless then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because all language would be insufficient.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I did not die, and I alive remained not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What I became, being of both deprived.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And better with a giant I compare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than do the giants with those arms of his;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Consider now how great must be that whole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which unto such a part conforms itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lifted up his brow against his Maker,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well may proceed from him all tribulation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O, what a marvel it appeared to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I beheld three faces on his head!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The one in front, and that vermilion was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two were the others, that were joined with this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above the middle part of either shoulder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they were joined together at the crest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the right-hand one seemed ’twixt white and yellow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The left was such to look upon as those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as befitting were so great a bird;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sails of the sea I never saw so large.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No feathers had they, but as of a bat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their fashion was; and he was waving them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trickled the teardrops and the bloody drivel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sinner, in the manner of a brake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he three of them tormented thus.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him in front the biting was as naught</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That soul up there which has the greatest pain,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Master said, “is Judas Iscariot;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With head inside, he plies his legs without.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the two others, who head downward are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But night is reascending, and ’tis time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That we depart, for we have seen the whole.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he the vantage seized of time and place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when the wings were opened wide apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From fell to fell descended downward then</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we were come to where the thigh revolves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turned round his head where he had had his legs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that to Hell I thought we were returning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Master said, panting as one fatigued,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Must we perforce depart from so much evil.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then through the opening of a rock he issued,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And down upon the margin seated me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then tow’rds me he outstretched his wary step.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lucifer in the same way I had left him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I beheld him upward hold his legs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if I then became disquieted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let stolid people think who do not see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What the point is beyond which I had passed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Rise up,” the Master said, “upon thy feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The way is long, and difficult the road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now the sun to middle-tierce returns.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was not any palace corridor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where we were, but dungeon natural,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With floor uneven and unease of light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Master,” said I when I had arisen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“To draw me from an error speak a little;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus upside down? and how in such short time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Thou still imaginest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That side thou wast, so long as I descended;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which things heavy draw from every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now beneath the hemisphere art come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Opposite that which overhangs the vast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dry-land, and ’neath whose cope was put to death</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Man who without sin was born and lived.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which makes the other face of the Judecca.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here it is morn when it is evening there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he who with his hair a stairway made us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still fixed remaineth as he was before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the land, that whilom here emerged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For fear of him made of the sea a veil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To flee from him, what on this side appears</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A place there is below, from Beelzebub</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far receding as the tomb extends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which not by sight is known, but by the sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With course that winds about and slightly falls.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Guide and I into that hidden road</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now entered, to return to the bright world;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And without care of having any rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We mounted up, he first and I the second,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till I beheld through a round aperture</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.</span>
