			<h2>Paradiso</h2>
			<p id="id03337" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto I</p>
			<p id="id03338" style="margin-top: 2em">The glory of Him who moveth everything<br/>
			Doth penetrate the universe, and shine<br/>
			In one part more and in another less.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03339">Within that heaven which most his light receives<br/>
			Was I, and things beheld which to repeat<br/>
			Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03340">Because in drawing near to its desire<br/>
			Our intellect ingulphs itself so far,<br/>
			That after it the memory cannot go.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03341">Truly whatever of the holy realm<br/>
			I had the power to treasure in my mind<br/>
			Shall now become the subject of my song.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03342">O good Apollo, for this last emprise<br/>
			Make of me such a vessel of thy power<br/>
			As giving the beloved laurel asks!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03343">One summit of Parnassus hitherto<br/>
			Has been enough for me, but now with both<br/>
			I needs must enter the arena left.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03344">Enter into my bosom, thou, and breathe<br/>
			As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw<br/>
			Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03345">O power divine, lend'st thou thyself to me<br/>
			So that the shadow of the blessed realm<br/>
			Stamped in my brain I can make manifest,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03346">Thou'lt see me come unto thy darling tree,<br/>
			And crown myself thereafter with those leaves<br/>
			Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03347">So seldom, Father, do we gather them<br/>
			For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,<br/>
			(The fault and shame of human inclinations,)<br/></p>
			<p id="id03348">That the Peneian foliage should bring forth<br/>
			Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,<br/>
			When any one it makes to thirst for it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03349">A little spark is followed by great flame;<br/>
			Perchance with better voices after me<br/>
			Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03350">To mortal men by passages diverse<br/>
			Uprises the world's lamp; but by that one<br/>
			Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03351">With better course and with a better star<br/>
			Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax<br/>
			Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03352">Almost that passage had made morning there<br/>
			And evening here, and there was wholly white<br/>
			That hemisphere, and black the other part,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03353">When Beatrice towards the left-hand side<br/>
			I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;<br/>
			Never did eagle fasten so upon it!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03354">And even as a second ray is wont<br/>
			To issue from the first and reascend,<br/>
			Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03355">Thus of her action, through the eyes infused<br/>
			In my imagination, mine I made,<br/>
			And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03356">There much is lawful which is here unlawful<br/>
			Unto our powers, by virtue of the place<br/>
			Made for the human species as its own.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03357">Not long I bore it, nor so little while<br/>
			But I beheld it sparkle round about<br/>
			Like iron that comes molten from the fire;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03358">And suddenly it seemed that day to day<br/>
			Was added, as if He who has the power<br/>
			Had with another sun the heaven adorned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03359">With eyes upon the everlasting wheels<br/>
			Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her<br/>
			Fixing my vision from above removed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03360">Such at her aspect inwardly became<br/>
			As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him<br/>
			Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03361">To represent transhumanise in words<br/>
			Impossible were; the example, then, suffice<br/>
			Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03362">If I was merely what of me thou newly<br/>
			Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,<br/>
			Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03363">When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal<br/>
			Desiring thee, made me attentive to it<br/>
			By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03364">Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled<br/>
			By the sun's flame, that neither rain nor river<br/>
			E'er made a lake so widely spread abroad.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03365">The newness of the sound and the great light<br/>
			Kindled in me a longing for their cause,<br/>
			Never before with such acuteness felt;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03366">Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself,<br/>
			To quiet in me my perturbed mind,<br/>
			Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03367">And she began: "Thou makest thyself so dull<br/>
			With false imagining, that thou seest not<br/>
			What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03368">Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest;<br/>
			But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,<br/>
			Ne'er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03369">If of my former doubt I was divested<br/>
			By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,<br/>
			I in a new one was the more ensnared;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03370">And said: "Already did I rest content<br/>
			From great amazement; but am now amazed<br/>
			In what way I transcend these bodies light."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03371">Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,<br/>
			Her eyes directed tow'rds me with that look<br/>
			A mother casts on a delirious child;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03372">And she began: "All things whate'er they be<br/>
			Have order among themselves, and this is form,<br/>
			That makes the universe resemble God.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03373">Here do the higher creatures see the footprints<br/>
			Of the Eternal Power, which is the end<br/>
			Whereto is made the law already mentioned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03374">In the order that I speak of are inclined<br/>
			All natures, by their destinies diverse,<br/>
			More or less near unto their origin;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03375">Hence they move onward unto ports diverse<br/>
			O'er the great sea of being; and each one<br/>
			With instinct given it which bears it on.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03376">This bears away the fire towards the moon;<br/>
			This is in mortal hearts the motive power<br/>
			This binds together and unites the earth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03377">Nor only the created things that are<br/>
			Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,<br/>
			But those that have both intellect and love.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03378">The Providence that regulates all this<br/>
			Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,<br/>
			Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03379">And thither now, as to a site decreed,<br/>
			Bears us away the virtue of that cord<br/>
			Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03380">True is it, that as oftentimes the form<br/>
			Accords not with the intention of the art,<br/>
			Because in answering is matter deaf,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03381">So likewise from this course doth deviate<br/>
			Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,<br/>
			Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03382">(In the same wise as one may see the fire<br/>
			Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus<br/>
			Earthward is wrested by some false delight.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03383">Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,<br/>
			At thine ascent, than at a rivulet<br/>
			From some high mount descending to the lowland.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03384">Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived<br/>
			Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,<br/>
			As if on earth the living fire were quiet."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03385">Thereat she heavenward turned again her face.</p>
			<p id="id03386" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto II</p>
			<p id="id03387" style="margin-top: 2em">O Ye, who in some pretty little boat,<br/>
			Eager to listen, have been following<br/>
			Behind my ship, that singing sails along,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03388">Turn back to look again upon your shores;<br/>
			Do not put out to sea, lest peradventure,<br/>
			In losing me, you might yourselves be lost.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03389">The sea I sail has never yet been passed;<br/>
			Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,<br/>
			And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03390">Ye other few who have the neck uplifted<br/>
			Betimes to th' bread of Angels upon which<br/>
			One liveth here and grows not sated by it,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03391">Well may you launch upon the deep salt-sea<br/>
			Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you<br/>
			Upon the water that grows smooth again.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03392">Those glorious ones who unto Colchos passed<br/>
			Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be,<br/>
			When Jason they beheld a ploughman made!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03393">The con-created and perpetual thirst<br/>
			For the realm deiform did bear us on,<br/>
			As swift almost as ye the heavens behold.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03394">Upward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;<br/>
			And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt<br/>
			And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03395">Arrived I saw me where a wondrous thing<br/>
			Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she<br/>
			From whom no care of mine could be concealed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03396">Towards me turning, blithe as beautiful,<br/>
			Said unto me: "Fix gratefully thy mind<br/>
			On God, who unto the first star has brought us."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03397">It seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,<br/>
			Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright<br/>
			As adamant on which the sun is striking.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03398">Into itself did the eternal pearl<br/>
			Receive us, even as water doth receive<br/>
			A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03399">If I was body, (and we here conceive not<br/>
			How one dimension tolerates another,<br/>
			Which needs must be if body enter body,)<br/></p>
			<p id="id03400">More the desire should be enkindled in us<br/>
			That essence to behold, wherein is seen<br/>
			How God and our own nature were united.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03401">There will be seen what we receive by faith,<br/>
			Not demonstrated, but self-evident<br/>
			In guise of the first truth that man believes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03402">I made reply: "Madonna, as devoutly<br/>
			As most I can do I give thanks to Him<br/>
			Who has removed me from the mortal world.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03403">But tell me what the dusky spots may be<br/>
			Upon this body, which below on earth<br/>
			Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03404">Somewhat she smiled; and then, "If the opinion<br/>
			Of mortals be erroneous," she said,<br/>
			"Where'er the key of sense doth not unlock,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03405">Certes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee<br/>
			Now, forasmuch as, following the senses,<br/>
			Thou seest that the reason has short wings.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03406">But tell me what thou think'st of it thyself."<br/>
			And I: "What seems to us up here diverse,<br/>
			Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03407">And she: "Right truly shalt thou see immersed<br/>
			In error thy belief, if well thou hearest<br/>
			The argument that I shall make against it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03408">Lights many the eighth sphere displays to you<br/>
			Which in their quality and quantity<br/>
			May noted be of aspects different.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03409">If this were caused by rare and dense alone,<br/>
			One only virtue would there be in all<br/>
			Or more or less diffused, or equally.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03410">Virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits<br/>
			Of formal principles; and these, save one,<br/>
			Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03411">Besides, if rarity were of this dimness<br/>
			The cause thou askest, either through and through<br/>
			This planet thus attenuate were of matter,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03412">Or else, as in a body is apportioned<br/>
			The fat and lean, so in like manner this<br/>
			Would in its volume interchange the leaves.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03413">Were it the former, in the sun's eclipse<br/>
			It would be manifest by the shining through<br/>
			Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03414">This is not so; hence we must scan the other,<br/>
			And if it chance the other I demolish,<br/>
			Then falsified will thy opinion be.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03415">But if this rarity go not through and through,<br/>
			There needs must be a limit, beyond which<br/>
			Its contrary prevents the further passing,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03416">And thence the foreign radiance is reflected,<br/>
			Even as a colour cometh back from glass,<br/>
			The which behind itself concealeth lead.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03417">Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself<br/>
			More dimly there than in the other parts,<br/>
			By being there reflected farther back.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03418">From this reply experiment will free thee<br/>
			If e'er thou try it, which is wont to be<br/>
			The fountain to the rivers of your arts.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03419">Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove<br/>
			Alike from thee, the other more remote<br/>
			Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03420">Turned towards these, cause that behind thy back<br/>
			Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors<br/>
			And coming back to thee by all reflected.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03421">Though in its quantity be not so ample<br/>
			The image most remote, there shalt thou see<br/>
			How it perforce is equally resplendent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03422">Now, as beneath the touches of warm rays<br/>
			Naked the subject of the snow remains<br/>
			Both of its former colour and its cold,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03423">Thee thus remaining in thy intellect,<br/>
			Will I inform with such a living light,<br/>
			That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03424">Within the heaven of the divine repose<br/>
			Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies<br/>
			The being of whatever it contains.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03425">The following heaven, that has so many eyes,<br/>
			Divides this being by essences diverse,<br/>
			Distinguished from it, and by it contained.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03426">The other spheres, by various differences,<br/>
			All the distinctions which they have within them<br/>
			Dispose unto their ends and their effects.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03427">Thus do these organs of the world proceed,<br/>
			As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;<br/>
			Since from above they take, and act beneath.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03428">Observe me well, how through this place I come<br/>
			Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter<br/>
			Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford<br/></p>
			<p id="id03429">The power and motion of the holy spheres,<br/>
			As from the artisan the hammer's craft,<br/>
			Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03430">The heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,<br/>
			From the Intelligence profound, which turns it,<br/>
			The image takes, and makes of it a seal.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03431">And even as the soul within your dust<br/>
			Through members different and accommodated<br/>
			To faculties diverse expands itself,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03432">So likewise this Intelligence diffuses<br/>
			Its virtue multiplied among the stars.<br/>
			Itself revolving on its unity.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03433">Virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage<br/>
			Make with the precious body that it quickens,<br/>
			In which, as life in you, it is combined.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03434">From the glad nature whence it is derived,<br/>
			The mingled virtue through the body shines,<br/>
			Even as gladness through the living pupil.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03435">From this proceeds whate'er from light to light<br/>
			Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:<br/>
			This is the formal principle that produces,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03436">According to its goodness, dark and bright."</p>
			<p id="id03437" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto III</p>
			<p id="id03438" style="margin-top: 2em">That Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,<br/>
			Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,<br/>
			By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03439">And, that I might confess myself convinced<br/>
			And confident, so far as was befitting,<br/>
			I lifted more erect my head to speak.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03440">But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me<br/>
			So close to it, in order to be seen,<br/>
			That my confession I remembered not.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03441">Such as through polished and transparent glass,<br/>
			Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,<br/>
			But not so deep as that their bed be lost,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03442">Come back again the outlines of our faces<br/>
			So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white<br/>
			Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03443">Such saw I many faces prompt to speak,<br/>
			So that I ran in error opposite<br/>
			To that which kindled love 'twixt man and fountain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03444">As soon as I became aware of them,<br/>
			Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,<br/>
			To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03445">And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward<br/>
			Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,<br/>
			Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03446">"Marvel thou not," she said to me, "because<br/>
			I smile at this thy puerile conceit,<br/>
			Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03447">But turns thee, as 'tis wont, on emptiness.<br/>
			True substances are these which thou beholdest,<br/>
			Here relegate for breaking of some vow.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03448">Therefore speak with them, listen and believe;<br/>
			For the true light, which giveth peace to them,<br/>
			Permits them not to turn from it their feet."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03449">And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful<br/>
			To speak directed me, and I began,<br/>
			As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03450">"O well-created spirit, who in the rays<br/>
			Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste<br/>
			Which being untasted ne'er is comprehended,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03451">Grateful 'twill be to me, if thou content me<br/>
			Both with thy name and with your destiny."<br/>
			Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03452">"Our charity doth never shut the doors<br/>
			Against a just desire, except as one<br/>
			Who wills that all her court be like herself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03453">I was a virgin sister in the world;<br/>
			And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,<br/>
			The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03454">But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,<br/>
			Who, stationed here among these other blessed,<br/>
			Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03455">All our affections, that alone inflamed<br/>
			Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,<br/>
			Rejoice at being of his order formed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03456">And this allotment, which appears so low,<br/>
			Therefore is given us, because our vows<br/>
			Have been neglected and in some part void."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03457">Whence I to her: "In your miraculous aspects<br/>
			There shines I know not what of the divine,<br/>
			Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03458">Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance;<br/>
			But what thou tellest me now aids me so,<br/>
			That the refiguring is easier to me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03459">But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,<br/>
			Are you desirous of a higher place,<br/>
			To see more or to make yourselves more friends?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id03460">First with those other shades she smiled a little;<br/>
			Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,<br/>
			She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03461">"Brother, our will is quieted by virtue<br/>
			Of charity, that makes us wish alone<br/>
			For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03462">If to be more exalted we aspired,<br/>
			Discordant would our aspirations be<br/>
			Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03463">Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,<br/>
			If being in charity is needful here,<br/>
			And if thou lookest well into its nature;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03464">Nay, 'tis essential to this blest existence<br/>
			To keep itself within the will divine,<br/>
			Whereby our very wishes are made one;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03465">So that, as we are station above station<br/>
			Throughout this realm, to all the realm 'tis pleasing,<br/>
			As to the King, who makes his will our will.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03466">And his will is our peace; this is the sea<br/>
			To which is moving onward whatsoever<br/>
			It doth create, and all that nature makes."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03467">Then it was clear to me how everywhere<br/>
			In heaven is Paradise, although the grace<br/>
			Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03468">But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,<br/>
			And for another still remains the longing,<br/>
			We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03469">E'en thus did I; with gesture and with word,<br/>
			To learn from her what was the web wherein<br/>
			She did not ply the shuttle to the end.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03470">"A perfect life and merit high in-heaven<br/>
			A lady o'er us," said she, "by whose rule<br/>
			Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03471">That until death they may both watch and sleep<br/>
			Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts<br/>
			Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03472">To follow her, in girlhood from the world<br/>
			I fled, and in her habit shut myself,<br/>
			And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03473">Then men accustomed unto evil more<br/>
			Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;<br/>
			God knows what afterward my life became.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03474">This other splendour, which to thee reveals<br/>
			Itself on my right side, and is enkindled<br/>
			With all the illumination of our sphere,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03475">What of myself I say applies to her;<br/>
			A nun was she, and likewise from her head<br/>
			Was ta'en the shadow of the sacred wimple.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03476">But when she too was to the world returned<br/>
			Against her wishes and against good usage,<br/>
			Of the heart's veil she never was divested.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03477">Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,<br/>
			Who from the second wind of Suabia<br/>
			Brought forth the third and latest puissance."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03478">Thus unto me she spake, and then began<br/>
			"Ave Maria" singing, and in singing<br/>
			Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03479">My sight, that followed her as long a time<br/>
			As it was possible, when it had lost her<br/>
			Turned round unto the mark of more desire,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03480">And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;<br/>
			But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,<br/>
			That at the first my sight endured it not;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03481">And this in questioning more backward made me.</p>
			<p id="id03482" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto IV</p>
			<p id="id03483" style="margin-top: 2em">Between two viands, equally removed<br/>
			And tempting, a free man would die of hunger<br/>
			Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03484">So would a lamb between the ravenings<br/>
			Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;<br/>
			And so would stand a dog between two does.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03485">Hence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not,<br/>
			Impelled in equal measure by my doubts,<br/>
			Since it must be so, nor do I commend.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03486">I held my peace; but my desire was painted<br/>
			Upon my face, and questioning with that<br/>
			More fervent far than by articulate speech.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03487">Beatrice did as Daniel had done<br/>
			Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath<br/>
			Which rendered him unjustly merciless,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03488">And said: "Well see I how attracteth thee<br/>
			One and the other wish, so that thy care<br/>
			Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03489">Thou arguest, if good will be permanent,<br/>
			The violence of others, for what reason<br/>
			Doth it decrease the measure of my merit?<br/></p>
			<p id="id03490">Again for doubting furnish thee occasion<br/>
			Souls seeming to return unto the stars,<br/>
			According to the sentiment of Plato.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03491">These are the questions which upon thy wish<br/>
			Are thrusting equally; and therefore first<br/>
			Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03492">He of the Seraphim most absorbed in God,<br/>
			Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John<br/>
			Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03493">Have not in any other heaven their seats,<br/>
			Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,<br/>
			Nor of existence more or fewer years;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03494">But all make beautiful the primal circle,<br/>
			And have sweet life in different degrees,<br/>
			By feeling more or less the eternal breath.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03495">They showed themselves here, not because allotted<br/>
			This sphere has been to them, but to give sign<br/>
			Of the celestial which is least exalted.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03496">To speak thus is adapted to your mind,<br/>
			Since only through the sense it apprehendeth<br/>
			What then it worthy makes of intellect.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03497">On this account the Scripture condescends<br/>
			Unto your faculties, and feet and hands<br/>
			To God attributes, and means something else;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03498">And Holy Church under an aspect human<br/>
			Gabriel and Michael represent to you,<br/>
			And him who made Tobias whole again.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03499">That which Timaeus argues of the soul<br/>
			Doth not resemble that which here is seen,<br/>
			Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03500">He says the soul unto its star returns,<br/>
			Believing it to have been severed thence<br/>
			Whenever nature gave it as a form.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03501">Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise<br/>
			Than the words sound, and possibly may be<br/>
			With meaning that is not to be derided.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03502">If he doth mean that to these wheels return<br/>
			The honour of their influence and the blame,<br/>
			Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03503">This principle ill understood once warped<br/>
			The whole world nearly, till it went astray<br/>
			Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03504">The other doubt which doth disquiet thee<br/>
			Less venom has, for its malevolence<br/>
			Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03505">That as unjust our justice should appear<br/>
			In eyes of mortals, is an argument<br/>
			Of faith, and not of sin heretical.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03506">But still, that your perception may be able<br/>
			To thoroughly penetrate this verity,<br/>
			As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03507">If it be violence when he who suffers<br/>
			Co-operates not with him who uses force,<br/>
			These souls were not on that account excused;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03508">For will is never quenched unless it will,<br/>
			But operates as nature doth in fire<br/>
			If violence a thousand times distort it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03509">Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds<br/>
			The force; and these have done so, having power<br/>
			Of turning back unto the holy place.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03510">If their will had been perfect, like to that<br/>
			Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,<br/>
			And Mutius made severe to his own hand,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03511">It would have urged them back along the road<br/>
			Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;<br/>
			But such a solid will is all too rare.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03512">And by these words, if thou hast gathered them<br/>
			As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted<br/>
			That would have still annoyed thee many times.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03513">But now another passage runs across<br/>
			Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself<br/>
			Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03514">I have for certain put into thy mind<br/>
			That soul beatified could never lie,<br/>
			For it is near the primal Truth,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03515">And then thou from Piccarda might'st have heard<br/>
			Costanza kept affection for the veil,<br/>
			So that she seemeth here to contradict me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03516">Many times, brother, has it come to pass,<br/>
			That, to escape from peril, with reluctance<br/>
			That has been done it was not right to do,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03517">E'en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father<br/>
			Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)<br/>
			Not to lose pity pitiless became.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03518">At this point I desire thee to remember<br/>
			That force with will commingles, and they cause<br/>
			That the offences cannot be excused.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03519">Will absolute consenteth not to evil;<br/>
			But in so far consenteth as it fears,<br/>
			If it refrain, to fall into more harm.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03520">Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,<br/>
			She meaneth the will absolute, and I<br/>
			The other, so that both of us speak truth."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03521">Such was the flowing of the holy river<br/>
			That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;<br/>
			This put to rest my wishes one and all.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03522">"O love of the first lover, O divine,"<br/>
			Said I forthwith, "whose speech inundates me<br/>
			And warms me so, it more and more revives me,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03523">My own affection is not so profound<br/>
			As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;<br/>
			Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03524">Well I perceive that never sated is<br/>
			Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,<br/>
			Beyond which nothing true expands itself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03525">It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,<br/>
			When it attains it; and it can attain it;<br/>
			If not, then each desire would frustrate be.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03526">Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,<br/>
			Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,<br/>
			Which to the top from height to height impels us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03527">This doth invite me, this assurance give me<br/>
			With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you<br/>
			Another truth, which is obscure to me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03528">I wish to know if man can satisfy you<br/>
			For broken vows with other good deeds, so<br/>
			That in your balance they will not be light."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03529">Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes<br/>
			Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,<br/>
			That, overcome my power, I turned my back<br/></p>
			<p id="id03530">And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.</p>
			<p id="id03531" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto V</p>
			<p id="id03532" style="margin-top: 2em">"If in the heat of love I flame upon thee<br/>
			Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,<br/>
			So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03533">Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds<br/>
			From perfect sight, which as it apprehends<br/>
			To the good apprehended moves its feet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03534">Well I perceive how is already shining<br/>
			Into thine intellect the eternal light,<br/>
			That only seen enkindles always love;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03535">And if some other thing your love seduce,<br/>
			'Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,<br/>
			Ill understood, which there is shining through.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03536">Thou fain wouldst know if with another service<br/>
			For broken vow can such return be made<br/>
			As to secure the soul from further claim."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03537">This Canto thus did Beatrice begin;<br/>
			And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,<br/>
			Continued thus her holy argument:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03538">"The greatest gift that in his largess God<br/>
			Creating made, and unto his own goodness<br/>
			Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize<br/></p>
			<p id="id03539">Most highly, is the freedom of the will,<br/>
			Wherewith the creatures of intelligence<br/>
			Both all and only were and are endowed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03540">Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,<br/>
			The high worth of a vow, if it he made<br/>
			So that when thou consentest God consents:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03541">For, closing between God and man the compact,<br/>
			A sacrifice is of this treasure made,<br/>
			Such as I say, and made by its own act.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03542">What can be rendered then as compensation?<br/>
			Think'st thou to make good use of what thou'st offered,<br/>
			With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03543">Now art thou certain of the greater point;<br/>
			But because Holy Church in this dispenses,<br/>
			Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03544">Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table,<br/>
			Because the solid food which thou hast taken<br/>
			Requireth further aid for thy digestion.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03545">Open thy mind to that which I reveal,<br/>
			And fix it there within; for 'tis not knowledge,<br/>
			The having heard without retaining it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03546">In the essence of this sacrifice two things<br/>
			Convene together; and the one is that<br/>
			Of which 'tis made, the other is the agreement.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03547">This last for evermore is cancelled not<br/>
			Unless complied with, and concerning this<br/>
			With such precision has above been spoken.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03548">Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews<br/>
			To offer still, though sometimes what was offered<br/>
			Might be commuted, as thou ought'st to know.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03549">The other, which is known to thee as matter,<br/>
			May well indeed be such that one errs not<br/>
			If it for other matter be exchanged.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03550">But let none shift the burden on his shoulder<br/>
			At his arbitrament, without the turning<br/>
			Both of the white and of the yellow key;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03551">And every permutation deem as foolish,<br/>
			If in the substitute the thing relinquished,<br/>
			As the four is in six, be not contained.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03552">Therefore whatever thing has so great weight<br/>
			In value that it drags down every balance,<br/>
			Cannot be satisfied with other spending.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03553">Let mortals never take a vow in jest;<br/>
			Be faithful and not blind in doing that,<br/>
			As Jephthah was in his first offering,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03554">Whom more beseemed to say, 'I have done wrong,<br/>
			Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish<br/>
			Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03555">Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face,<br/>
			And made for her both wise and simple weep,<br/>
			Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.'<br/></p>
			<p id="id03556">Christians, be ye more serious in your movements;<br/>
			Be ye not like a feather at each wind,<br/>
			And think not every water washes you.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03557">Ye have the Old and the New Testament,<br/>
			And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you<br/>
			Let this suffice you unto your salvation.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03558">If evil appetite cry aught else to you,<br/>
			Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,<br/>
			So that the Jew among you may not mock you.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03559">Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon<br/>
			Its mother's milk, and frolicsome and simple<br/>
			Combats at its own pleasure with itself."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03560">Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;<br/>
			Then all desireful turned herself again<br/>
			To that part where the world is most alive.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03561">Her silence and her change of countenance<br/>
			Silence imposed upon my eager mind,<br/>
			That had already in advance new questions;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03562">And as an arrow that upon the mark<br/>
			Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,<br/>
			So did we speed into the second realm.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03563">My Lady there so joyful I beheld,<br/>
			As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,<br/>
			More luminous thereat the planet grew;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03564">And if the star itself was changed and smiled,<br/>
			What became I, who by my nature am<br/>
			Exceeding mutable in every guise!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03565">As, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil,<br/>
			The fishes draw to that which from without<br/>
			Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03566">So I beheld more than a thousand splendours<br/>
			Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:<br/>
			"Lo, this is she who shall increase our love."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03567">And as each one was coming unto us,<br/>
			Full of beatitude the shade was seen,<br/>
			By the effulgence clear that issued from it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03568">Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning<br/>
			No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have<br/>
			An agonizing need of knowing more;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03569">And of thyself thou'lt see how I from these<br/>
			Was in desire of hearing their conditions,<br/>
			As they unto mine eyes were manifest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03570">"O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes<br/>
			To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,<br/>
			Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned<br/></p>
			<p id="id03571">With light that through the whole of heaven is spread<br/>
			Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest<br/>
			To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03572">Thus by some one among those holy spirits<br/>
			Was spoken, and by Beatrice: "Speak, speak<br/>
			Securely, and believe them even as Gods."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03573">"Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself<br/>
			In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,<br/>
			Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03574">But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,<br/>
			Spirit august, thy station in the sphere<br/>
			That veils itself to men in alien rays."<br/></p>
			<p id="id03575">This said I in direction of the light<br/>
			Which first had spoken to me; whence it became<br/>
			By far more lucent than it was before.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03576">Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself<br/>
			By too much light, when heat has worn away<br/>
			The tempering influence of the vapours dense,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03577">By greater rapture thus concealed itself<br/>
			In its own radiance the figure saintly,<br/>
			And thus close, close enfolded answered me<br/></p>
			<p id="id03578">In fashion as the following Canto sings.</p>
			<p id="id03579" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto VI</p>

			<p id="id03590">In order that thou see with how great reason<br/>

			Both who appropriate and who oppose it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03591">Behold how great a power has made it worthy<br/>
			Of reverence, beginning from the hour<br/>

			<p id="id03594">Thou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans<br/>

			Against the other princes and confederates.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03595">Torquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks<br/>
			Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii,<br/>

			<p id="id03596">It struck to earth the pride of the Arabians,<br/>

			Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03598">Then, near unto the time when heaven had willed<br/>

			<p id="id04193">Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,<br/>
			Two of them my regard attentive followed<br/>
			As followeth the eye its falcon flying.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04194">William thereafterward, and Renouard,<br/>

			<p id="id04199">So I became aware that my gyration<br/>

			That miracle beholding more adorned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04200">And such as is the change, in little lapse<br/>
			Of time, in a pale woman, when her face<br/>
			Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04201">Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,<br/>

			The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04202">Within that Jovial torch did I behold<br/>
			The sparkling of the love which was therein<br/>
			Delineate our language to mine eyes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04203">And even as birds uprisen from the shore,<br/>

			Have I descended but to give thee welcome<br/>
			With words, and with the light that mantles me;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04350">Nor did more love cause me to be more ready,<br/>
			For love as much and more up there is burning,<br/>
			As doth the flaming manifest to thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04351">But the high charity, that makes us servants<br/>
			Prompt to the counsel which controls the world,<br/>
			Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04352">"I see full well," said I, "O sacred lamp!<br/>
			How love unfettered in this court sufficeth<br/>
			To follow the eternal Providence;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04353">But this is what seems hard for me to see,<br/>
			Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone<br/>
			Unto this office from among thy consorts."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04354">No sooner had I come to the last word,<br/>
			Than of its middle made the light a centre,<br/>
			Whirling itself about like a swift millstone.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04355">When answer made the love that was therein:<br/>
			"On me directed is a light divine,<br/>
			Piercing through this in which I am embosomed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04356">Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined<br/>
			Lifts me above myself so far, I see<br/>
			The supreme essence from which this is drawn.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04357">Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame,<br/>
			For to my sight, as far as it is clear,<br/>
			The clearness of the flame I equal make.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04358">But that soul in the heaven which is most pure,<br/>
			That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,<br/>
			Could this demand of thine not satisfy;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04359">Because so deeply sinks in the abyss<br/>
			Of the eternal statute what thou askest,<br/>
			From all created sight it is cut off.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04360">And to the mortal world, when thou returnest,<br/>
			This carry back, that it may not presume<br/>
			Longer tow'rd such a goal to move its feet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04361">The mind, that shineth here, on earth doth smoke;<br/>
			From this observe how can it do below<br/>
			That which it cannot though the heaven assume it?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id04362">Such limit did its words prescribe to me,<br/>
			The question I relinquished, and restricted<br/>
			Myself to ask it humbly who it was.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04363">"Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs,<br/>
			And not far distant from thy native place,<br/>
			So high, the thunders far below them sound,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04364">And form a ridge that Catria is called,<br/>
			'Neath which is consecrate a hermitage<br/>
			Wont to be dedicate to worship only."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04365">Thus unto me the third speech recommenced,<br/>
			And then, continuing, it said: "Therein<br/>
			Unto God's service I became so steadfast,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04366">That feeding only on the juice of olives<br/>
			Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts,<br/>
			Contented in my thoughts contemplative.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04367">That cloister used to render to these heavens<br/>
			Abundantly, and now is empty grown,<br/>
			So that perforce it soon must be revealed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04368">I in that place was Peter Damiano;<br/>
			And Peter the Sinner was I in the house<br/>
			Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04369">Little of mortal life remained to me,<br/>
			When I was called and dragged forth to the hat<br/>
			Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04370">Came Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came<br/>
			Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted,<br/>
			Taking the food of any hostelry.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04371">Now some one to support them on each side<br/>
			The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them,<br/>
			So heavy are they, and to hold their trains.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04372">They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks,<br/>
			So that two beasts go underneath one skin;<br/>
			O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id04373">At this voice saw I many little flames<br/>
			From step to step descending and revolving,<br/>
			And every revolution made them fairer.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04374">Round about this one came they and stood still,<br/>
			And a cry uttered of so loud a sound,<br/>
			It here could find no parallel, nor I<br/></p>
			<p id="id04375">Distinguished it, the thunder so o'ercame me.</p>
			<p id="id04376" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXII</p>
			<p id="id04377" style="margin-top: 2em">Oppressed with stupor, I unto my guide<br/>
			Turned like a little child who always runs<br/>
			For refuge there where he confideth most;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04378">And she, even as a mother who straightway<br/>
			Gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy<br/>
			With voice whose wont it is to reassure him,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04379">Said to me: "Knowest thou not thou art in heaven,<br/>
			And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all<br/>
			And what is done here cometh from good zeal?<br/></p>
			<p id="id04380">After what wise the singing would have changed thee<br/>
			And I by smiling, thou canst now imagine,<br/>
			Since that the cry has startled thee so much,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04381">In which if thou hadst understood its prayers<br/>
			Already would be known to thee the vengeance<br/>
			Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04382">The sword above here smiteth not in haste<br/>
			Nor tardily, howe'er it seem to him<br/>
			Who fearing or desiring waits for it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04383">But turn thee round towards the others now,<br/>
			For very illustrious spirits shalt thou see,<br/>
			If thou thy sight directest as I say."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04384">As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,<br/>
			And saw a hundred spherules that together<br/>
			With mutual rays each other more embellished.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04385">I stood as one who in himself represses<br/>
			The point of his desire, and ventures not<br/>
			To question, he so feareth the too much.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04386">And now the largest and most luculent<br/>
			Among those pearls came forward, that it might<br/>
			Make my desire concerning it content.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04387">Within it then I heard: "If thou couldst see<br/>
			Even as myself the charity that burns<br/>
			Among us, thy conceits would be expressed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04388">But, that by waiting thou mayst not come late<br/>
			To the high end, I will make answer even<br/>
			Unto the thought of which thou art so chary.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04389">That mountain on whose slope Cassino stands<br/>
			Was frequented of old upon its summit<br/>
			By a deluded folk and ill-disposed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04390">And I am he who first up thither bore<br/>
			The name of Him who brought upon the earth<br/>
			The truth that so much sublimateth us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04391">And such abundant grace upon me shone<br/>
			That all the neighbouring towns I drew away<br/>
			From the impious worship that seduced the world.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04392">These other fires, each one of them, were men<br/>
			Contemplative, enkindled by that heat<br/>
			Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04393">Here is Macarius, here is Romualdus,<br/>
			Here are my brethren, who within the cloisters<br/>
			Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04394">And I to him: "The affection which thou showest<br/>
			Speaking with me, and the good countenance<br/>
			Which I behold and note in all your ardours,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04395">In me have so my confidence dilated<br/>
			As the sun doth the rose, when it becomes<br/>
			As far unfolded as it hath the power.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04396">Therefore I pray, and thou assure me, father,<br/>
			If I may so much grace receive, that I<br/>
			May thee behold with countenance unveiled."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04397">He thereupon: "Brother, thy high desire<br/>
			In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled,<br/>
			Where are fulfilled all others and my own.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04398">There perfect is, and ripened, and complete,<br/>
			Every desire; within that one alone<br/>
			Is every part where it has always been;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04399">For it is not in space, nor turns on poles,<br/>
			And unto it our stairway reaches up,<br/>
			Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04400">Up to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it<br/>
			Extending its supernal part, what time<br/>
			So thronged with angels it appeared to him.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04401">But to ascend it now no one uplifts<br/>
			His feet from off the earth, and now my Rule<br/>
			Below remaineth for mere waste of paper.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04402">The walls that used of old to be an Abbey<br/>
			Are changed to dens of robbers, and the cowls<br/>
			Are sacks filled full of miserable flour.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04403">But heavy usury is not taken up<br/>
			So much against God's pleasure as that fruit<br/>
			Which maketh so insane the heart of monks;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04404">For whatsoever hath the Church in keeping<br/>
			Is for the folk that ask it in God's name,<br/>
			Not for one's kindred or for something worse.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04405">The flesh of mortals is so very soft,<br/>
			That good beginnings down below suffice not<br/>
			From springing of the oak to bearing acorns.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04406">Peter began with neither gold nor silver,<br/>
			And I with orison and abstinence,<br/>
			And Francis with humility his convent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04407">And if thou lookest at each one's beginning,<br/>
			And then regardest whither he has run,<br/>
			Thou shalt behold the white changed into brown.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04408">In verity the Jordan backward turned,<br/>
			And the sea's fleeing, when God willed were more<br/>
			A wonder to behold, than succour here."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04409">Thus unto me he said; and then withdrew<br/>
			To his own band, and the band closed together;<br/>
			Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04410">The gentle Lady urged me on behind them<br/>
			Up o'er that stairway by a single sign,<br/>
			So did her virtue overcome my nature;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04411">Nor here below, where one goes up and down<br/>
			By natural law, was motion e'er so swift<br/>
			That it could be compared unto my wing.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04412">Reader, as I may unto that devout<br/>
			Triumph return, on whose account I often<br/>
			For my transgressions weep and beat my breast,—<br/></p>
			<p id="id04413">Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire<br/>
			And drawn it out again, before I saw<br/>
			The sign that follows Taurus, and was in it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04414">O glorious stars, O light impregnated<br/>
			With mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge<br/>
			All of my genius, whatsoe'er it be,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04415">With you was born, and hid himself with you,<br/>
			He who is father of all mortal life,<br/>
			When first I tasted of the Tuscan air;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04416">And then when grace was freely given to me<br/>
			To enter the high wheel which turns you round,<br/>
			Your region was allotted unto me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04417">To you devoutly at this hour my soul<br/>
			Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire<br/>
			For the stern pass that draws it to itself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04418">"Thou art so near unto the last salvation,"<br/>
			Thus Beatrice began, "thou oughtest now<br/>
			To have thine eves unclouded and acute;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04419">And therefore, ere thou enter farther in,<br/>
			Look down once more, and see how vast a world<br/>
			Thou hast already put beneath thy feet;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04420">So that thy heart, as jocund as it may,<br/>
			Present itself to the triumphant throng<br/>
			That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04421">I with my sight returned through one and all<br/>
			The sevenfold spheres, and I beheld this globe<br/>
			Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04422">And that opinion I approve as best<br/>
			Which doth account it least; and he who thinks<br/>
			Of something else may truly be called just.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04423">I saw the daughter of Latona shining<br/>
			Without that shadow, which to me was cause<br/>
			That once I had believed her rare and dense.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04424">The aspect of thy son, Hyperion,<br/>
			Here I sustained, and saw how move themselves<br/>
			Around and near him Maia and Dione.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04425">Thence there appeared the temperateness of Jove<br/>
			'Twixt son and father, and to me was clear<br/>
			The change that of their whereabout they make;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04426">And all the seven made manifest to me<br/>
			How great they are, and eke how swift they are,<br/>
			And how they are in distant habitations.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04427">The threshing-floor that maketh us so proud,<br/>
			To me revolving with the eternal Twins,<br/>
			Was all apparent made from hill to harbour!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04428">Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes I turned.</p>
			<p id="id04429" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXIII</p>
			<p id="id04430" style="margin-top: 2em">Even as a bird, 'mid the beloved leaves,<br/>
			Quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood<br/>
			Throughout the night, that hideth all things from us,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04431">Who, that she may behold their longed-for looks<br/>
			And find the food wherewith to nourish them,<br/>
			In which, to her, grave labours grateful are,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04432">Anticipates the time on open spray<br/>
			And with an ardent longing waits the sun,<br/>
			Gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn:<br/></p>
			<p id="id04433">Even thus my Lady standing was, erect<br/>
			And vigilant, turned round towards the zone<br/>
			Underneath which the sun displays less haste;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04434">So that beholding her distraught and wistful,<br/>
			Such I became as he is who desiring<br/>
			For something yearns, and hoping is appeased.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04435">But brief the space from one When to the other;<br/>
			Of my awaiting, say I, and the seeing<br/>
			The welkin grow resplendent more and more.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04436">And Beatrice exclaimed: "Behold the hosts<br/>
			Of Christ's triumphal march, and all the fruit<br/>
			Harvested by the rolling of these spheres!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id04437">It seemed to me her face was all aflame;<br/>
			And eyes she had so full of ecstasy<br/>
			That I must needs pass on without describing.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04438">As when in nights serene of the full moon<br/>
			Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal<br/>
			Who paint the firmament through all its gulfs,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04439">Saw I, above the myriads of lamps,<br/>
			A Sun that one and all of them enkindled,<br/>
			E'en as our own doth the supernal sights,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04440">And through the living light transparent shone<br/>
			The lucent substance so intensely clear<br/>
			Into my sight, that I sustained it not.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04441">O Beatrice, thou gentle guide and dear!<br/>
			To me she said: "What overmasters thee<br/>
			A virtue is from which naught shields itself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04442">There are the wisdom and the omnipotence<br/>
			That oped the thoroughfares 'twixt heaven and earth,<br/>
			For which there erst had been so long a yearning."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04443">As fire from out a cloud unlocks itself,<br/>
			Dilating so it finds not room therein,<br/>
			And down, against its nature, falls to earth,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04444">So did my mind, among those aliments<br/>
			Becoming larger, issue from itself,<br/>
			And that which it became cannot remember.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04445">"Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:<br/>
			Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough<br/>
			Hast thou become to tolerate my smile."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04446">I was as one who still retains the feeling<br/>
			Of a forgotten vision, and endeavours<br/>
			In vain to bring it back into his mind,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04447">When I this invitation heard, deserving<br/>
			Of so much gratitude, it never fades<br/>
			Out of the book that chronicles the past.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04448">If at this moment sounded all the tongues<br/>
			That Polyhymnia and her sisters made<br/>
			Most lubrical with their delicious milk,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04449">To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth<br/>
			It would not reach, singing the holy smile<br/>
			And how the holy aspect it illumed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04450">And therefore, representing Paradise,<br/>
			The sacred poem must perforce leap over,<br/>
			Even as a man who finds his way cut off;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04451">But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,<br/>
			And of the mortal shoulder laden with it,<br/>
			Should blame it not, if under this it tremble.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04452">It is no passage for a little boat<br/>
			This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,<br/>
			Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04453">"Why doth my face so much enamour thee,<br/>
			That to the garden fair thou turnest not,<br/>
			Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming?<br/></p>
			<p id="id04454">There is the Rose in which the Word Divine<br/>
			Became incarnate; there the lilies are<br/>
			By whose perfume the good way was discovered."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04455">Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels<br/>
			Was wholly ready, once again betook me<br/>
			Unto the battle of the feeble brows.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04456">As in the sunshine, that unsullied streams<br/>
			Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers<br/>
			Mine eyes with shadow covered o'er have seen,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04457">So troops of splendours manifold I saw<br/>
			Illumined from above with burning rays,<br/>
			Beholding not the source of the effulgence.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04458">O power benignant that dost so imprint them!<br/>
			Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope<br/>
			There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04459">The name of that fair flower I e'er invoke<br/>
			Morning and evening utterly enthralled<br/>
			My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04460">And when in both mine eyes depicted were<br/>
			The glory and greatness of the living star<br/>
			Which there excelleth, as it here excelled,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04461">Athwart the heavens a little torch descended<br/>
			Formed in a circle like a coronal,<br/>
			And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04462">Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth<br/>
			On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,<br/>
			Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04463">Compared unto the sounding of that lyre<br/>
			Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,<br/>
			Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04464">"I am Angelic Love, that circle round<br/>
			The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb<br/>

			<p id="id04465">And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while<br/>
			Thou followest thy Son, and mak'st diviner<br/>
			The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04466">Thus did the circulated melody<br/>
			Seal itself up; and all the other lights<br/>
			Were making to resound the name of Mary.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04467">The regal mantle of the volumes all<br/>
			Of that world, which most fervid is and living<br/>
			With breath of God and with his works and ways,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04468">Extended over us its inner border,<br/>
			So very distant, that the semblance of it<br/>
			There where I was not yet appeared to me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04469">Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power<br/>
			Of following the incoronated flame,<br/>
			Which mounted upward near to its own seed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04470">And as a little child, that towards its mother<br/>
			Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken,<br/>
			Through impulse kindled into outward flame,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04471">Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached<br/>
			So with its summit, that the deep affection<br/>
			They had for Mary was revealed to me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04472">Thereafter they remained there in my sight,<br/>
			'Regina coeli' singing with such sweetness,<br/>
			That ne'er from me has the delight departed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04473">O, what exuberance is garnered up<br/>
			Within those richest coffers, which had been<br/>
			Good husbandmen for sowing here below!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04474">There they enjoy and live upon the treasure<br/>
			Which was acquired while weeping in the exile<br/>
			Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04475">There triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son<br/>
			Of God and Mary, in his victory,<br/>
			Both with the ancient council and the new,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04476">He who doth keep the keys of such a glory.</p>
			<p id="id04477" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXIV</p>

			<p id="id04481">Thus Beatrice; and those souls beatified<br/>
			Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles,<br/>
			Flaming intensely in the guise of comets.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04482">And as the wheels in works of horologes<br/>

			<p id="id04484">From that one which I noted of most beauty<br/>

			<p id="id04485">And around Beatrice three several times<br/>

			<p id="id04486">Therefore the pen skips, and I write it not,<br/>

			<p id="id04487">"O holy sister mine, who us implorest<br/>
			With such devotion, by thine ardent love<br/>
			Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id04488">Thereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire<br/>

			To argue it, and not to terminate it,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04494">So did I arm myself with every reason,<br/>
			While she was speaking, that I might be ready<br/>
			For such a questioner and such profession.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04495">"Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself;<br/>
			What is the Faith?"  Whereat I raised my brow<br/>
			Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04496">Then turned I round to Beatrice, and she<br/>
			Prompt signals made to me that I should pour<br/>
			The water forth from my internal fountain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04497">"May grace, that suffers me to make confession,"<br/>
			Began I, "to the great centurion,<br/>
			Cause my conceptions all to be explicit!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id04498">And I continued: "As the truthful pen,<br/>
			Father, of thy dear brother wrote of it,<br/>
			Who put with thee Rome into the good way,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04499">Faith is the substance of the things we hope for,<br/>
			And evidence of those that are not seen;<br/>
			And this appears to me its quiddity."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04500">Then heard I: "Very rightly thou perceivest,<br/>
			If well thou understandest why he placed it<br/>
			With substances and then with evidences."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04501">And I thereafterward: "The things profound,<br/>
			That here vouchsafe to me their apparition,<br/>
			Unto all eyes below are so concealed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04502">That they exist there only in belief,<br/>
			Upon the which is founded the high hope,<br/>
			And hence it takes the nature of a substance.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04503">And it behoveth us from this belief<br/>
			To reason without having other sight,<br/>
			And hence it has the nature of evidence."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04504">Then heard I: "If whatever is acquired<br/>
			Below by doctrine were thus understood,<br/>
			No sophist's subtlety would there find place."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04505">Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love;<br/>
			Then added: "Very well has been gone over<br/>
			Already of this coin the alloy and weight;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04506">But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?"<br/>
			And I: "Yes, both so shining and so round<br/>
			That in its stamp there is no peradventure."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04507">Thereafter issued from the light profound<br/>
			That there resplendent was: "This precious jewel,<br/>
			Upon the which is every virtue founded,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04508">Whence hadst thou it?"  And I: "The large outpouring<br/>
			Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused<br/>
			Upon the ancient parchments and the new,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04509">A syllogism is, which proved it to me<br/>
			With such acuteness, that, compared therewith,<br/>
			All demonstration seems to me obtuse."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04510">And then I heard: "The ancient and the new<br/>
			Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive,<br/>
			Why dost thou take them for the word divine?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id04511">And I: "The proofs, which show the truth to me,<br/>
			Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature<br/>
			Ne'er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04512">'Twas answered me: "Say, who assureth thee<br/>
			That those works ever were? the thing itself<br/>
			That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04513">"Were the world to Christianity converted,"<br/>
			I said, "withouten miracles, this one<br/>
			Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04514">Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter<br/>
			Into the field to sow there the good plant,<br/>
			Which was a vine and has become a thorn!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id04515">This being finished, the high, holy Court<br/>
			Resounded through the spheres, "One God we praise!"<br/>
			In melody that there above is chanted.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04516">And then that Baron, who from branch to branch,<br/>
			Examining, had thus conducted me,<br/>
			Till the extremest leaves we were approaching,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04517">Again began: "The Grace that dallying<br/>
			Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened,<br/>
			Up to this point, as it should opened be,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04518">So that I do approve what forth emerged;<br/>
			But now thou must express what thou believest,<br/>
			And whence to thy belief it was presented."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04519">"O holy father, spirit who beholdest<br/>
			What thou believedst so that thou o'ercamest,<br/>
			Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,"<br/></p>
			<p id="id04520">Began I, "thou dost wish me in this place<br/>
			The form to manifest of my prompt belief,<br/>
			And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04521">And I respond: In one God I believe,<br/>
			Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens<br/>
			With love and with desire, himself unmoved;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04522">And of such faith not only have I proofs<br/>
			Physical and metaphysical, but gives them<br/>
			Likewise the truth that from this place rains down<br/></p>
			<p id="id04523">Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,<br/>
			Through the Evangel, and through you, who wrote<br/>
			After the fiery Spirit sanctified you;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04524">In Persons three eterne believe, and these<br/>
			One essence I believe, so one and trine<br/>
			They bear conjunction both with 'sunt' and 'est.'<br/></p>
			<p id="id04525">With the profound condition and divine<br/>
			Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind<br/>
			Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04526">This the beginning is, this is the spark<br/>
			Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame,<br/>
			And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04527">Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him<br/>
			His servant straight embraces, gratulating<br/>
			For the good news as soon as he is silent;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04528">So, giving me its benediction, singing,<br/>
			Three times encircled me, when I was silent,<br/>
			The apostolic light, at whose command<br/></p>
			<p id="id04529">I spoken had, in speaking I so pleased him.</p>
			<p id="id04530" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXV</p>
			<p id="id04531" style="margin-top: 2em">If e'er it happen that the Poem Sacred,<br/>

			<p id="id04534">Because into the Faith that maketh known<br/>
			All souls to God there entered I, and then<br/>

			<p id="id04535">Thereafterward towards us moved a light<br/>
			Out of that band whence issued the first-fruits<br/>

			<p id="id04536">And then my Lady, full of ecstasy,<br/>

			<p id="id04537">In the same way as, when a dove alights<br/>

			<p id="id04539">But when their gratulations were complete,<br/>
			Silently 'coram me' each one stood still,<br/>
			So incandescent it o'ercame my sight.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04540">Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:<br/>
			"Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions<br/>
			Of our Basilica have been described,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04541">Make Hope resound within this altitude;<br/>

			<p id="id04542">"Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;<br/>

			Must needs be ripened in our radiance."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04543">This comfort came to me from the second fire;<br/>
			Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,<br/>
			Which bent them down before with too great weight.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04544">"Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou<br/>

			Thus did the second light again continue.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04547">And the Compassionate, who piloted<br/>
			The plumage of my wings in such high flight,<br/>
			Did in reply anticipate me thus:<br/></p>
			<p id="id04548">"No child whatever the Church Militant<br/>

			<p id="id04550">The two remaining points, that not for knowledge<br/>

			How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04551">To him I leave; for hard he will not find them,<br/>
			Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;<br/>
			And may the grace of God in this assist him!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id04552">As a disciple, who his teacher follows,<br/>
			Ready and willing, where he is expert,<br/>
			That his proficiency may be displayed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04553">"Hope," said I, "is the certain expectation<br/>
			Of future glory, which is the effect<br/>
			Of grace divine and merit precedent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04554">From many stars this light comes unto me;<br/>
			But he instilled it first into my heart<br/>
			Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04555">'Sperent in te,' in the high Theody<br/>

			<p id="id04557">While I was speaking, in the living bosom<br/>
			Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,<br/>
			Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04558">Then breathed: "The love wherewith I am inflamed<br/>
			Towards the virtue still which followed me<br/>
			Unto the palm and issue of the field,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04559">Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight<br/>
			In her; and grateful to me is thy telling<br/>
			Whatever things Hope promises to thee."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04560">And I: "The ancient Scriptures and the new<br/>
			The mark establish, and this shows it me,<br/>

			There where he treateth of the robes of white,<br/>
			This revelation manifests to us."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04563">And first, and near the ending of these words,<br/>
			"Sperent in te" from over us was heard,<br/>
			To which responsive answered all the carols.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04564">Thereafterward a light among them brightened,<br/>
			So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,<br/>

			<p id="id04565">And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance<br/>
			A winsome maiden, only to do honour<br/>
			To the new bride, and not from any failing,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04566">Even thus did I behold the brightened splendour<br/>
			Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved<br/>
			As was beseeming to their ardent love.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04567">Into the song and music there it entered;<br/>
			And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,<br/>
			Even as a bride silent and motionless.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04568">"This is the one who lay upon the breast<br/>
			Of him our Pelican; and this is he<br/>
			To the great office from the cross elected."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04569">My Lady thus; but therefore none the more<br/>
			Did move her sight from its attentive gaze<br/>
			Before or afterward these words of hers.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04570">Even as a man who gazes, and endeavours<br/>
			To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,<br/>
			And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04571">So I became before that latest fire,<br/>
			While it was said, "Why dost thou daze thyself<br/>
			To see a thing which here hath no existence?<br/></p>
			<p id="id04572">Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be<br/>

			<p id="id04574">And at this utterance the flaming circle<br/>

			<p id="id04578" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXVI</p>
			<p id="id04579" style="margin-top: 2em">While I was doubting for my vision quenched,<br/>

			<p id="id04580">Saying: "While thou recoverest the sense<br/>

			The power the hand of Ananias had."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04583">I said: "As pleaseth her, or soon or late<br/>

			<p id="id04585">The selfsame voice, that taken had from me<br/>
			The terror of the sudden dazzlement,<br/>

			<p id="id04586">And said: "In verity with finer sieve<br/>
			Behoveth thee to sift; thee it behoveth<br/>
			To say who aimed thy bow at such a target."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04587">And I: "By philosophic arguments,<br/>
			And by authority that hence descends,<br/>
			Such love must needs imprint itself in me;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04588">For Good, so far as good, when comprehended<br/>
			Doth straight enkindle love, and so much greater<br/>
			As more of goodness in itself it holds;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04589">Then to that Essence (whose is such advantage<br/>
			That every good which out of it is found<br/>
			Is nothing but a ray of its own light)<br/></p>
			<p id="id04590">More than elsewhither must the mind be moved<br/>
			Of every one, in loving, who discerns<br/>
			The truth in which this evidence is founded.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04591">Such truth he to my intellect reveals<br/>
			Who demonstrates to me the primal love<br/>
			Of all the sempiternal substances.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04592">The voice reveals it of the truthful Author,<br/>
			Who says to Moses, speaking of Himself,<br/>
			'I will make all my goodness pass before thee.'<br/></p>
			<p id="id04593">Thou too revealest it to me, beginning<br/>
			The loud Evangel, that proclaims the secret<br/>
			Of heaven to earth above all other edict."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04594">And I heard say: "By human intellect<br/>
			And by authority concordant with it,<br/>
			Of all thy loves reserve for God the highest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04595">But say again if other cords thou feelest,<br/>
			Draw thee towards Him, that thou mayst proclaim<br/>
			With how many teeth this love is biting thee."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04596">The holy purpose of the Eagle of Christ<br/>
			Not latent was, nay, rather I perceived<br/>
			Whither he fain would my profession lead.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04597">Therefore I recommenced: "All of those bites<br/>

			<p id="id04599">With the forementioned vivid consciousness<br/>
			Have drawn me from the sea of love perverse,<br/>
			And of the right have placed me on the shore.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04600">The leaves, wherewith embowered is all the garden<br/>
			Of the Eternal Gardener, do I love<br/>
			As much as he has granted them of good."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04601">As soon as I had ceased, a song most sweet<br/>
			Throughout the heaven resounded, and my Lady<br/>
			Said with the others, "Holy, holy, holy!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id04602">And as at some keen light one wakes from sleep<br/>

			So all unconscious is his sudden waking,<br/>
			Until the judgment cometh to his aid,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04604">So from before mine eyes did Beatrice<br/>

			That cast its light a thousand miles and more.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04605">Whence better after than before I saw,<br/>
			And in a kind of wonderment I asked<br/>
			About a fourth light that I saw with us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04606">And said my Lady: "There within those rays<br/>
			Gazes upon its Maker the first soul<br/>
			That ever the first virtue did create."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04607">Even as the bough that downward bends its top<br/>
			At transit of the wind, and then is lifted<br/>
			By its own virtue, which inclines it upward,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04608">Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking,<br/>
			Being amazed, and then I was made bold<br/>
			By a desire to speak wherewith I burned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04609">And I began: "O apple, that mature<br/>

			So that his impulse needs must be apparent,<br/>
			By reason of the wrappage following it;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04612">And in like manner the primeval soul<br/>
			Made clear to me athwart its covering<br/>
			How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04613">Then breathed: "Without thy uttering it to me,<br/>
			Thine inclination better I discern<br/>
			Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04614">For I behold it in the truthful mirror,<br/>
			That of Himself all things parhelion makes,<br/>
			And none makes Him parhelion of itself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04615">Thou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me<br/>
			Within the lofty garden, where this Lady<br/>
			Unto so long a stairway thee disposed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04616">And how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure,<br/>
			And of the great disdain the proper cause,<br/>
			And the language that I used and that I made.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04617">Now, son of mine, the tasting of the tree<br/>
			Not in itself was cause of so great exile,<br/>

			Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty,<br/>
			Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04620">The language that I spake was quite extinct<br/>
			Before that in the work interminable<br/>

			<p id="id04621">For nevermore result of reasoning<br/>

			<p id="id04699">My Lady thus; then said she: "Do thou take<br/>
			What I shall tell thee, if thou wouldst be sated,<br/>
			And exercise on that thy subtlety.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04700">The circles corporal are wide and narrow<br/>

			Scant would it be to serve the present turn.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04783">Not only does the beauty I beheld<br/>
			Transcend ourselves, but truly I believe<br/>
			Its Maker only may enjoy it all.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04784">Vanquished do I confess me by this passage<br/>
			More than by problem of his theme was ever<br/>
			O'ercome the comic or the tragic poet;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04785">For as the sun the sight that trembles most,<br/>
			Even so the memory of that sweet smile<br/>
			My mind depriveth of its very self.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04786">From the first day that I beheld her face<br/>
			In this life, to the moment of this look,<br/>
			The sequence of my song has ne'er been severed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04787">But now perforce this sequence must desist<br/>
			From following her beauty with my verse,<br/>
			As every artist at his uttermost.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04788">Such as I leave her to a greater fame<br/>
			Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing<br/>
			Its arduous matter to a final close,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04789">With voice and gesture of a perfect leader<br/>
			She recommenced: "We from the greatest body<br/>
			Have issued to the heaven that is pure light;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04790">Light intellectual replete with love,<br/>
			Love of true good replete with ecstasy,<br/>
			Ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04791">Here shalt thou see the one host and the other<br/>
			Of Paradise, and one in the same aspects<br/>
			Which at the final judgment thou shalt see."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04792">Even as a sudden lightning that disperses<br/>
			The visual spirits, so that it deprives<br/>
			The eye of impress from the strongest objects,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04793">Thus round about me flashed a living light,<br/>
			And left me swathed around with such a veil<br/>
			Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04794">"Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven<br/>
			Welcomes into itself with such salute,<br/>
			To make the candle ready for its flame."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04795">No sooner had within me these brief words<br/>
			An entrance found, than I perceived myself<br/>
			To be uplifted over my own power,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04796">And I with vision new rekindled me,<br/>
			Such that no light whatever is so pure<br/>
			But that mine eyes were fortified against it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04797">And light I saw in fashion of a river<br/>
			Fulvid with its effulgence, 'twixt two banks<br/>
			Depicted with an admirable Spring.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04798">Out of this river issued living sparks,<br/>
			And on all sides sank down into the flowers,<br/>
			Like unto rubies that are set in gold;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04799">And then, as if inebriate with the odours,<br/>
			They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,<br/>
			And as one entered issued forth another.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04800">"The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee<br/>
			To have intelligence of what thou seest,<br/>
			Pleaseth me all the more, the more it swells.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04801">But of this water it behoves thee drink<br/>
			Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked."<br/>
			Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04802">And added: "The river and the topazes<br/>
			Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage,<br/>
			Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04803">Not that these things are difficult in themselves,<br/>
			But the deficiency is on thy side,<br/>
			For yet thou hast not vision so exalted."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04804">There is no babe that leaps so suddenly<br/>
			With face towards the milk, if he awake<br/>
			Much later than his usual custom is,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04805">As I did, that I might make better mirrors<br/>
			Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave<br/>
			Which flows that we therein be better made.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04806">And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids<br/>
			Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me<br/>
			Out of its length to be transformed to round.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04807">Then as a folk who have been under masks<br/>
			Seem other than before, if they divest<br/>
			The semblance not their own they disappeared in,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04808">Thus into greater pomp were changed for me<br/>
			The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw<br/>
			Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04809">O splendour of God! by means of which I saw<br/>
			The lofty triumph of the realm veracious,<br/>
			Give me the power to say how it I saw!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04810">There is a light above, which visible<br/>
			Makes the Creator unto every creature,<br/>
			Who only in beholding Him has peace,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04811">And it expands itself in circular form<br/>
			To such extent, that its circumference<br/>
			Would be too large a girdle for the sun.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04812">The semblance of it is all made of rays<br/>
			Reflected from the top of Primal Motion,<br/>
			Which takes therefrom vitality and power.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04813">And as a hill in water at its base<br/>
			Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty<br/>
			When affluent most in verdure and in flowers,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04814">So, ranged aloft all round about the light,<br/>
			Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand<br/>
			All who above there have from us returned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04815">And if the lowest row collect within it<br/>
			So great a light, how vast the amplitude<br/>
			Is of this Rose in its extremest leaves!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04816">My vision in the vastness and the height<br/>
			Lost not itself, but comprehended all<br/>
			The quantity and quality of that gladness.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04817">There near and far nor add nor take away;<br/>
			For there where God immediately doth govern,<br/>
			The natural law in naught is relevant.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04818">Into the yellow of the Rose Eternal<br/>
			That spreads, and multiplies, and breathes an odour<br/>
			Of praise unto the ever-vernal Sun,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04819">As one who silent is and fain would speak,<br/>
			Me Beatrice drew on, and said: "Behold<br/>
			Of the white stoles how vast the convent is!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04820">Behold how vast the circuit of our city!<br/>
			Behold our seats so filled to overflowing,<br/>
			That here henceforward are few people wanting!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04821">On that great throne whereon thine eyes are fixed<br/>
			For the crown's sake already placed upon it,<br/>
			Before thou suppest at this wedding feast<br/></p>
			<p id="id04822">Shall sit the soul (that is to be Augustus<br/>
			On earth) of noble Henry, who shall come<br/>
			To redress Italy ere she be ready.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04823">Blind covetousness, that casts its spell upon you,<br/>
			Has made you like unto the little child,<br/>
			Who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04824">And in the sacred forum then shall be<br/>
			A Prefect such, that openly or covert<br/>
			On the same road he will not walk with him.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04825">But long of God he will not be endured<br/>

			<p id="id04827" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXXI</p>
			<p id="id04828" style="margin-top: 2em">In fashion then as of a snow-white rose<br/>
			Displayed itself to me the saintly host,<br/>
			Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04829">But the other host, that flying sees and sings<br/>
			The glory of Him who doth enamour it,<br/>
			And the goodness that created it so noble,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04830">Even as a swarm of bees, that sinks in flowers<br/>
			One moment, and the next returns again<br/>
			To where its labour is to sweetness turned,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04831">Sank into the great flower, that is adorned<br/>
			With leaves so many, and thence reascended<br/>
			To where its love abideth evermore.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04832">Their faces had they all of living flame,<br/>
			And wings of gold, and all the rest so white<br/>
			No snow unto that limit doth attain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04833">From bench to bench, into the flower descending,<br/>
			They carried something of the peace and ardour<br/>
			Which by the fanning of their flanks they won.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04834">Nor did the interposing 'twixt the flower<br/>
			And what was o'er it of such plenitude<br/>
			Of flying shapes impede the sight and splendour;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04835">Because the light divine so penetrates<br/>
			The universe, according to its merit,<br/>
			That naught can be an obstacle against it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04836">This realm secure and full of gladsomeness,<br/>
			Crowded with ancient people and with modern,<br/>
			Unto one mark had all its look and love.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04837">O Trinal Light, that in a single star<br/>
			Sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them,<br/>
			Look down upon our tempest here below!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04838">If the barbarians, coming from some region<br/>
			That every day by Helice is covered,<br/>
			Revolving with her son whom she delights in,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04839">Beholding Rome and all her noble works,<br/>
			Were wonder-struck, what time the Lateran<br/>
			Above all mortal things was eminent,—<br/></p>
			<p id="id04840">I who to the divine had from the human,<br/>
			From time unto eternity, had come,<br/>
			From Florence to a people just and sane,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04841">With what amazement must I have been filled!<br/>
			Truly between this and the joy, it was<br/>
			My pleasure not to hear, and to be mute.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04842">And as a pilgrim who delighteth him<br/>
			In gazing round the temple of his vow,<br/>
			And hopes some day to retell how it was,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04843">So through the living light my way pursuing<br/>
			Directed I mine eyes o'er all the ranks,<br/>
			Now up, now down, and now all round about.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04844">Faces I saw of charity persuasive,<br/>
			Embellished by His light and their own smile,<br/>
			And attitudes adorned with every grace.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04845">The general form of Paradise already<br/>
			My glance had comprehended as a whole,<br/>
			In no part hitherto remaining fixed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04846">And round I turned me with rekindled wish<br/>
			My Lady to interrogate of things<br/>
			Concerning which my mind was in suspense.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04847">One thing I meant, another answered me;<br/>
			I thought I should see Beatrice, and saw<br/>
			An Old Man habited like the glorious people.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04848">O'erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks<br/>
			With joy benign, in attitude of pity<br/>
			As to a tender father is becoming.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04849">And "She, where is she?" instantly I said;<br/>
			Whence he: "To put an end to thy desire,<br/>
			Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04850">And if thou lookest up to the third round<br/>
			Of the first rank, again shalt thou behold her<br/>
			Upon the throne her merits have assigned her."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04851">Without reply I lifted up mine eyes,<br/>
			And saw her, as she made herself a crown<br/>
			Reflecting from herself the eternal rays.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04852">Not from that region which the highest thunders<br/>
			Is any mortal eye so far removed,<br/>
			In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04853">As there from Beatrice my sight; but this<br/>
			Was nothing unto me; because her image<br/>
			Descended not to me by medium blurred.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04854">"O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,<br/>
			And who for my salvation didst endure<br/>
			In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04855">Of whatsoever things I have beheld,<br/>
			As coming from thy power and from thy goodness<br/>
			I recognise the virtue and the grace.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04856">Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom,<br/>
			By all those ways, by all the expedients,<br/>
			Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04857">Preserve towards me thy magnificence,<br/>
			So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed,<br/>
			Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04858">Thus I implored; and she, so far away,<br/>
			Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;<br/>
			Then unto the eternal fountain turned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04859">And said the Old Man holy: "That thou mayst<br/>
			Accomplish perfectly thy journeying,<br/>
			Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04860">Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden;<br/>
			For seeing it will discipline thy sight<br/>
			Farther to mount along the ray divine.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04861">And she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn<br/>
			Wholly with love, will grant us every grace,<br/>
			Because that I her faithful Bernard am."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04862">As he who peradventure from Croatia<br/>
			Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,<br/>
			Who through its ancient fame is never sated,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04863">But says in thought, the while it is displayed,<br/>
			"My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God,<br/>
			Now was your semblance made like unto this?"<br/></p>
			<p id="id04864">Even such was I while gazing at the living<br/>
			Charity of the man, who in this world<br/>
			By contemplation tasted of that peace.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04865">"Thou son of grace, this jocund life," began he,<br/>
			"Will not be known to thee by keeping ever<br/>
			Thine eyes below here on the lowest place;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04866">But mark the circles to the most remote,<br/>
			Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen<br/>
			To whom this realm is subject and devoted."<br/></p>
			<p id="id04867">I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn<br/>
			The oriental part of the horizon<br/>
			Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04868">Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale<br/>
			To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness<br/>
			Surpass in splendour all the other front.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04869">And even as there where we await the pole<br/>
			That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more<br/>
			The light, and is on either side diminished,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04870">So likewise that pacific oriflamme<br/>
			Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side<br/>
			In equal measure did the flame abate.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04871">And at that centre, with their wings expanded,<br/>
			More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,<br/>
			Each differing in effulgence and in kind.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04872">I saw there at their sports and at their songs<br/>
			A beauty smiling, which the gladness was<br/>
			Within the eyes of all the other saints;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04873">And if I had in speaking as much wealth<br/>
			As in imagining, I should not dare<br/>
			To attempt the smallest part of its delight.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04874">Bernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes<br/>
			Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour,<br/>
			His own with such affection turned to her<br/></p>
			<p id="id04875">That it made mine more ardent to behold.</p>
			<p id="id04876" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXXII</p>
			<p id="id04877" style="margin-top: 2em">Absorbed in his delight, that contemplator<br/>

			With Beatrice, in manner as thou seest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04880">Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and her who was<br/>
			Ancestress of the Singer, who for dole<br/>

			<p id="id04881">Canst thou behold from seat to seat descending<br/>
			Down in gradation, as with each one's name<br/>

			<p id="id04886">And as, upon this side, the glorious seat<br/>
			Of the Lady of Heaven, and the other seats<br/>
			Below it, such a great division make,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04887">So opposite doth that of the great John,<br/>
			Who, ever holy, desert and martyrdom<br/>
			Endured, and afterwards two years in Hell.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04888">And under him thus to divide were chosen<br/>

			In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04906">On her did I behold so great a gladness<br/>

			<p id="id04907">That whatsoever I had seen before<br/>
			Did not suspend me in such admiration,<br/>

			<p id="id04908">And the same Love that first descended there,<br/>
			"Ave Maria, gratia plena," singing,<br/>

			<p id="id04914">Because he is the one who bore the palm<br/>
			Down unto Mary, when the Son of God<br/>
			To take our burden on himself decreed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04915">But now come onward with thine eyes, as I<br/>
			Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians<br/>
			Of this most just and merciful of empires.<br/></p>

			The human species so much bitter tastes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04918">Upon the right thou seest that ancient father<br/>
			Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ<br/>
			The keys committed of this lovely flower.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04919">And he who all the evil days beheld,<br/>
			Before his death, of her the beauteous bride<br/>
			Who with the spear and with the nails was won,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04920">Beside him sits, and by the other rests<br/>

			Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved<br/>
			When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04923">But since the moments of thy vision fly,<br/>
			Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor<br/>
			Who makes the gown according to his cloth,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04924">And unto the first Love will turn our eyes,<br/>
			That looking upon Him thou penetrate<br/>
			As far as possible through his effulgence.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04925">Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,<br/>
			Moving thy wings believing to advance,<br/>
			By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04926">Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee;<br/>
			And thou shalt follow me with thy affection<br/>

			<p id="id04929" style="margin-top: 2em">"Thou Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son,<br/>
			Humble and high beyond all other creature,<br/>
			The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04930">Thou art the one who such nobility<br/>
			To human nature gave, that its Creator<br/>
			Did not disdain to make himself its creature.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04931">Within thy womb rekindled was the love,<br/>
			By heat of which in the eternal peace<br/>
			After such wise this flower has germinated.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04932">Here unto us thou art a noonday torch<br/>
			Of charity, and below there among mortals<br/>
			Thou art the living fountain-head of hope.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04933">Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,<br/>
			That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,<br/>
			His aspirations without wings would fly.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04934">Not only thy benignity gives succour<br/>
			To him who asketh it, but oftentimes<br/>
			Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04935">In thee compassion is, in thee is pity,<br/>
			In thee magnificence; in thee unites<br/>
			Whate'er of goodness is in any creature.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04936">Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth<br/>
			Of the universe as far as here has seen<br/>
			One after one the spiritual lives,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04937">Supplicate thee through grace for so much power<br/>
			That with his eyes he may uplift himself<br/>
			Higher towards the uttermost salvation.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04938">And I, who never burned for my own seeing<br/>
			More than I do for his, all of my prayers<br/>
			Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04939">That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud<br/>
			Of his mortality so with thy prayers,<br/>
			That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04940">Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst<br/>
			Whate'er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve<br/>
			After so great a vision his affections.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04941">Let thy protection conquer human movements;<br/>
			See Beatrice and all the blessed ones<br/>
			My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!"<br/></p>
			<p id="id04942">The eyes beloved and revered of God,<br/>
			Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us<br/>
			How grateful unto her are prayers devout;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04943">Then unto the Eternal Light they turned,<br/>
			On which it is not credible could be<br/>
			By any creature bent an eye so clear.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04944">And I, who to the end of all desires<br/>
			Was now approaching, even as I ought<br/>
			The ardour of desire within me ended.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04945">Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,<br/>
			That I should upward look; but I already<br/>
			Was of my own accord such as he wished;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04946">Because my sight, becoming purified,<br/>
			Was entering more and more into the ray<br/>
			Of the High Light which of itself is true.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04947">From that time forward what I saw was greater<br/>
			Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,<br/>
			And yields the memory unto such excess.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04948">Even as he is who seeth in a dream,<br/>
			And after dreaming the imprinted passion<br/>
			Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04949">Even such am I, for almost utterly<br/>
			Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet<br/>
			Within my heart the sweetness born of it;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04950">Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,<br/>
			Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves<br/>
			Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04951">O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee<br/>
			From the conceits of mortals, to my mind<br/>
			Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04952">And make my tongue of so great puissance,<br/>
			That but a single sparkle of thy glory<br/>
			It may bequeath unto the future people;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04953">For by returning to my memory somewhat,<br/>
			And by a little sounding in these verses,<br/>
			More of thy victory shall be conceived!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04954">I think the keenness of the living ray<br/>
			Which I endured would have bewildered me,<br/>
			If but mine eyes had been averted from it;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04955">And I remember that I was more bold<br/>
			On this account to bear, so that I joined<br/>
			My aspect with the Glory Infinite.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04956">O grace abundant, by which I presumed<br/>
			To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,<br/>
			So that the seeing I consumed therein!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04957">I saw that in its depth far down is lying<br/>
			Bound up with love together in one volume,<br/>
			What through the universe in leaves is scattered;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04958">Substance, and accident, and their operations,<br/>
			All interfused together in such wise<br/>
			That what I speak of is one simple light.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04959">The universal fashion of this knot<br/>
			Methinks I saw, since more abundantly<br/>
			In saying this I feel that I rejoice.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04960">One moment is more lethargy to me,<br/>
			Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise<br/>
			That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04961">My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,<br/>
			Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,<br/>
			And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04962">In presence of that light one such becomes,<br/>
			That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect<br/>
			It is impossible he e'er consent;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04963">Because the good, which object is of will,<br/>
			Is gathered all in this, and out of it<br/>
			That is defective which is perfect there.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04964">Shorter henceforward will my language fall<br/>
			Of what I yet remember, than an infant's<br/>
			Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04965">Not because more than one unmingled semblance<br/>
			Was in the living light on which I looked,<br/>
			For it is always what it was before;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04966">But through the sight, that fortified itself<br/>
			In me by looking, one appearance only<br/>
			To me was ever changing as I changed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04967">Within the deep and luminous subsistence<br/>
			Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,<br/>
			Of threefold colour and of one dimension,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04968">And by the second seemed the first reflected<br/>
			As Iris is by Iris, and the third<br/>
			Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04969">O how all speech is feeble and falls short<br/>
			Of my conceit, and this to what I saw<br/>
			Is such, 'tis not enough to call it little!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04970">O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,<br/>
			Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself<br/>
			And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04971">That circulation, which being thus conceived<br/>
			Appeared in thee as a reflected light,<br/>
			When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04972">Within itself, of its own very colour<br/>
			Seemed to me painted with our effigy,<br/>
			Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04973">As the geometrician, who endeavours<br/>
			To square the circle, and discovers not,<br/>
			By taking thought, the principle he wants,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04974">Even such was I at that new apparition;<br/>
			I wished to see how the image to the circle<br/>
			Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04975">But my own wings were not enough for this,<br/>
			Had it not been that then my mind there smote<br/>
			A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04976">Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy:<br/>
			But now was turning my desire and will,<br/>
			Even as a wheel that equally is moved,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04977">The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.</p>
