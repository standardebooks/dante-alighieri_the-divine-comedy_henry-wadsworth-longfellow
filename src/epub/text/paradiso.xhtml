					<span>I lift mine eyes, and all the windows blaze</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With forms of Saints and holy men who died,</span>

					<span class="i1">And Beatrice again at Dante’s side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more rebukes, but smiles her words of praise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then the organ sounds, and unseen choirs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sing the old Latin hymns of peace and love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And benedictions of the Holy Ghost;</span>

					<span>And the melodious bells among the spires</span>

					<span class="i1">Above the darkness of the Apennines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forerunner of the day that is to be!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The voices of the city and the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The voices of the mountains and the pines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Repeat thy song, till the familiar lines</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are footpaths for the thought of Italy!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through all the nations, and a sound is heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As of a mighty wind, and men devout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strangers of Rome, and the new proselytes,</span>

					<span class="i1">I had the power to treasure in my mind</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make of me such a vessel of thy power</span>

					<span class="i1">As giving the beloved laurel asks!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One summit of Parnassus hitherto</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has been enough for me, but now with both</span>

					<span class="i1">I needs must enter the arena left.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enter into my bosom, thou, and breathe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1202" id="noteref-1202" epub:type="noteref">1202</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1203" id="noteref-1203" epub:type="noteref">1203</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.</span>

					<span class="i1">So that the shadow of the blessed realm</span>

					<span class="i1">For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,</span>

					<span class="i1">(The fault and shame of human inclinations,)</span>

					<span>That the Peneian foliage should bring forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When anyone it makes to thirst for it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little spark is followed by great flame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance with better voices after me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1204" id="noteref-1204" epub:type="noteref">1204</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To mortal men by passages diverse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uprises the world’s lamp; but by that one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1205" id="noteref-1205" epub:type="noteref">1205</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With better course and with a better star</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1206" id="noteref-1206" epub:type="noteref">1206</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Almost that passage had made morning there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evening here, and there was wholly white<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1207" id="noteref-1207" epub:type="noteref">1207</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hemisphere, and black the other part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Beatrice towards the left-hand side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Never did eagle fasten so upon it!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as a second ray is wont</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To issue from the first and reascend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus of her action, through the eyes infused</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In my imagination, mine I made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There much is lawful which is here unlawful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto our powers, by virtue of the place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made for the human species as its own.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not long I bore it, nor so little while</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I beheld it sparkle round about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like iron that comes molten from the fire;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1208" id="noteref-1208" epub:type="noteref">1208</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And suddenly it seemed that day to day<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1209" id="noteref-1209" epub:type="noteref">1209</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was added, as if He who has the power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had with another sun the heaven adorned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With eyes upon the everlasting wheels</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fixing my vision from above removed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such at her aspect inwardly became</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1210" id="noteref-1210" epub:type="noteref">1210</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To represent transhumanize in words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Impossible were; the example, then, suffice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I was merely what of me thou newly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1211" id="noteref-1211" epub:type="noteref">1211</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1212" id="noteref-1212" epub:type="noteref">1212</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Desiring thee, made me attentive to it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1213" id="noteref-1213" epub:type="noteref">1213</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the sun’s flame, that neither rain nor river</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’er made a lake so widely spread abroad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The newness of the sound and the great light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kindled in me a longing for their cause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Never before with such acuteness felt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To quiet in me my perturbed mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she began: “Thou makest thyself so dull</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With false imagining, that thou seest not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1214" id="noteref-1214" epub:type="noteref">1214</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne’er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If of my former doubt I was divested</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I in a new one was the more ensnared;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “Already did I rest content</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From great amazement; but am now amazed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In what way I transcend these bodies light.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her eyes directed tow’rds me with that look</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A mother casts on a delirious child;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she began: “All things whate’er they be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have order among themselves, and this is form,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That makes the universe resemble God.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here do the higher creatures see the footprints</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the Eternal Power, which is the end</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereto is made the law already mentioned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the order that I speak of are inclined<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1215" id="noteref-1215" epub:type="noteref">1215</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All natures, by their destinies diverse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More or less near unto their origin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence they move onward unto ports diverse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er the great sea of being; and each one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With instinct given it which bears it on.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This bears away the fire towards the moon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This is in mortal hearts the motive power;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This binds together and unites the earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor only the created things that are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But those that have both intellect and love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Providence that regulates all this<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1216" id="noteref-1216" epub:type="noteref">1216</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1217" id="noteref-1217" epub:type="noteref">1217</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thither now, as to a site decreed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bears us away the virtue of that cord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True is it, that as oftentimes the form</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accords not with the intention of the art,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because in answering is matter deaf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So likewise from this course doth deviate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(In the same wise as one may see the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Earthward is wrested by some false delight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At thine ascent, than at a rivulet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From some high mount descending to the lowland.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if on earth the living fire were quiet.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1218" id="noteref-1218" epub:type="noteref">1218</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereat she heavenward turned again her face.</span>

					<span>Upward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1224" id="noteref-1224" epub:type="noteref">1224</a></span>

					<span class="i1">From whom no care of mine could be concealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Towards me turning, blithe as beautiful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me: “Fix gratefully thy mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On God, who unto the first star has brought us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As adamant on which the sun is striking.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into itself did the eternal pearl</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Receive us, even as water doth receive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I was body, (and we here conceive not</span>

					<span class="i1">How one dimension tolerates another,</span>

					<span class="i1">In guise of the first truth that man believes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I made reply: “Madonna, as devoutly</span>

					<span class="i1">As most I can do I give thanks to Him</span>

					<span>Somewhat she smiled; and then, “If the opinion</span>

					<span>And she: “Right truly shalt thou see immersed</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in their quality and quantity</span>

					<span class="i1">Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Besides, if rarity were of this dimness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1228" id="noteref-1228" epub:type="noteref">1228</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cause thou askest, either through and through</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This planet thus attenuate were of matter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or else, as in a body is apportioned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fat and lean, so in like manner this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would in its volume interchange the leaves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were it the former, in the sun’s eclipse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It would be manifest by the shining through</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is not so; hence we must scan the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if it chance the other I demolish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then falsified will thy opinion be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if this rarity go not through and through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There needs must be a limit, beyond which</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its contrary prevents the further passing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thence the foreign radiance is reflected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a color cometh back from glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which behind itself concealeth lead.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1229" id="noteref-1229" epub:type="noteref">1229</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More dimly there than in the other parts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By being there reflected farther back.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From this reply experiment will free thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If e’er thou try it, which is wont to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fountain to the rivers of your arts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Alike from thee, the other more remote</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turned towards these, cause that behind thy back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And coming back to thee by all reflected.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though in its quantity be not so ample</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The image most remote, there shalt thou see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How it perforce is equally resplendent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, as beneath the touches of warm rays</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Naked the subject of the snow remains<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1230" id="noteref-1230" epub:type="noteref">1230</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of its former color and its cold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee thus remaining in thy intellect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will I inform with such a living light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1231" id="noteref-1231" epub:type="noteref">1231</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the heaven of the divine repose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1232" id="noteref-1232" epub:type="noteref">1232</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies</span>
					<br/>

					<span>The following heaven, that has so many eyes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1233" id="noteref-1233" epub:type="noteref">1233</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All the distinctions which they have within them</span>

					<span class="i1">Dispose unto their ends and their effects.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus do these organs of the world proceed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since from above they take, and act beneath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Observe me well, how through this place I come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The power and motion of the holy spheres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As from the artisan the hammer’s craft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,</span>

					<span class="i1">To faculties diverse expands itself,</span>

					<span>So likewise this Intelligence diffuses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its virtue multiplied among the stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Itself revolving on its unity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make with the precious body that it quickens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which, as life in you, it is combined.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the glad nature whence it is derived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mingled virtue through the body shines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as gladness through the living pupil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From this proceeds whate’er from light to light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,</span>

					<span class="i1">By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, that I might confess myself convinced</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And confident, so far as was befitting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I lifted more erect my head to speak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So close to it, in order to be seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That my confession I remembered not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as through polished and transparent glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not so deep as that their bed be lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come back again the outlines of our faces</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such saw I many faces prompt to speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that I ran in error opposite</span>

					<span class="i1">To that which kindled love ’twixt man and fountain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1237" id="noteref-1237" epub:type="noteref">1237</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as I became aware of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Marvel thou not,” she said to me, “because</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I smile at this thy puerile conceit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But turns thee, as ’tis wont, on emptiness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">True substances are these which thou beholdest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here relegate for breaking of some vow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore speak with them, listen and believe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the true light, which giveth peace to them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Permits them not to turn from it their feet.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To speak directed me, and I began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O well-created spirit, who in the rays</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which being untasted ne’er is comprehended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grateful ’twill be to me, if thou content me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both with thy name and with your destiny.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1238" id="noteref-1238" epub:type="noteref">1238</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Our charity doth never shut the doors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against a just desire, except as one<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1239" id="noteref-1239" epub:type="noteref">1239</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who wills that all her court be like herself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was a virgin sister in the world;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, stationed here among these other blessed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All our affections, that alone inflamed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rejoice at being of his order formed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this allotment, which appears so low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore is given us, because our vows</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have been neglected and in some part void.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I to her: “In your miraculous aspects</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There shines I know not what of the divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But what thou tellest me now aids me so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the refiguring is easier to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are you desirous of a higher place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see more or to make yourselves more friends?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First with those other shades she smiled a little;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Brother, our will is quieted by virtue<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1240" id="noteref-1240" epub:type="noteref">1240</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of charity, that makes us wish alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If to be more exalted we aspired,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Discordant would our aspirations be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If being in charity is needful here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if thou lookest well into its nature;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay, ’tis essential to this blest existence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To keep itself within the will divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby our very wishes are made one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that, as we are station above station</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throughout this realm, to all the realm ’tis pleasing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to the King, who makes his will our will.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his will is our peace; this is the sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which is moving onward whatsoever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It doth create, and all that nature makes.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then it was clear to me how everywhere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In heaven is Paradise, although the grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for another still remains the longing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en thus did I; with gesture and with word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To learn from her what was the web wherein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She did not ply the shuttle to the end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A perfect life and merit high in-heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A lady o’er us,” said she, “by whose rule</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That until death they may both watch and sleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To follow her, in girlhood from the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I fled, and in her habit shut myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then men accustomed unto evil more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">God knows what afterward my life became.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This other splendor, which to thee reveals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Itself on my right side, and is enkindled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all the illumination of our sphere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What of myself I say applies to her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A nun was she, and likewise from her head</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was ta’en the shadow of the sacred wimple.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when she too was to the world returned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against her wishes and against good usage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the heart’s veil she never was divested.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1241" id="noteref-1241" epub:type="noteref">1241</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who from the second wind of Suabia</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Brought forth the third and latest puissance.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus unto me she spake, and then began</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ave Maria” singing, and in singing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My sight, that followed her as long a time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it was possible, when it had lost her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned round unto the mark of more desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That at the first my sight endured it not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this in questioning more backward made me.</span>

					<span class="i1">This sphere has been to them, but to give sign</span>

					<span class="i1">Whenever nature gave it as a form.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1254" id="noteref-1254" epub:type="noteref">1254</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than the words sound, and possibly may be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With meaning that is not to be derided.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he doth mean that to these wheels return</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The honor of their influence and the blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This principle ill understood once warped</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whole world nearly, till it went astray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1255" id="noteref-1255" epub:type="noteref">1255</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other doubt which doth disquiet thee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1256" id="noteref-1256" epub:type="noteref">1256</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Less venom has, for its malevolence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That as unjust our justice should appear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In eyes of mortals, is an argument</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of faith, and not of sin heretical.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But still, that your perception may be able</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To thoroughly penetrate this verity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If it be violence when he who suffers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cooperates not with him who uses force,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These souls were not on that account excused;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For will is never quenched unless it will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But operates as nature doth in fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If violence a thousand times distort it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The force; and these have done so, having power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of turning back unto the holy place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If their will had been perfect, like to that</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1257" id="noteref-1257" epub:type="noteref">1257</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Mutius made severe to his own hand,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1258" id="noteref-1258" epub:type="noteref">1258</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It would have urged them back along the road</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But such a solid will is all too rare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by these words, if thou hast gathered them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That would have still annoyed thee many times.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now another passage runs across</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have for certain put into thy mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That soul beatified could never lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For it is near the primal Truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then thou from Piccarda might’st have heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Costanza kept affection for the veil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that she seemeth here to contradict me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many times, brother, has it come to pass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, to escape from peril, with reluctance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That has been done it was not right to do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1259" id="noteref-1259" epub:type="noteref">1259</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not to lose pity pitiless became.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At this point I desire thee to remember</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That force with will commingles, and they cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the offences cannot be excused.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will absolute consenteth not to evil;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in so far consenteth as it fears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If it refrain, to fall into more harm.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She meaneth the will absolute, and I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other, so that both of us speak truth.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such was the flowing of the holy river</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This put to rest my wishes one and all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O love of the first lover, O divine,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1260" id="noteref-1260" epub:type="noteref">1260</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said I forthwith, “whose speech inundates me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And warms me so, it more and more revives me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My own affection is not so profound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well I perceive that never sated is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond which nothing true expands itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When it attains it; and it can attain it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If not, then each desire would frustrate be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1261" id="noteref-1261" epub:type="noteref">1261</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to the top from height to height impels us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This doth invite me, this assurance give me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another truth, which is obscure to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wish to know if man can satisfy you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For broken vows with other good deeds, so</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in your balance they will not be light.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1262" id="noteref-1262" epub:type="noteref">1262</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, overcome my power, I turned my back</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.</span>

				<p>
					<span>“If in the heat of love I flame upon thee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1263" id="noteref-1263" epub:type="noteref">1263</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the valor of thine eyes I vanquish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From perfect sight, which as it apprehends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the good apprehended moves its feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well I perceive how is already shining</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into thine intellect the eternal light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That only seen enkindles always love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if some other thing your love seduce,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1264" id="noteref-1264" epub:type="noteref">1264</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ill understood, which there is shining through.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou fain wouldst know if with another service</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For broken vow can such return be made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to secure the soul from further claim.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Canto thus did Beatrice begin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Continued thus her holy argument:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The greatest gift that in his largess God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Creating made, and unto his own goodness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Most highly, is the freedom of the will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith the creatures of intelligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both all and only were and are endowed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1265" id="noteref-1265" epub:type="noteref">1265</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The high worth of a vow, if it he made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that when thou consentest God consents:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, closing between God and man the compact,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sacrifice is of this treasure made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as I say, and made by its own act.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What can be rendered then as compensation?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Think’st thou to make good use of what thou’st offered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1266" id="noteref-1266" epub:type="noteref">1266</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now art thou certain of the greater point;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But because Holy Church in this dispenses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because the solid food which thou hast taken</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Requireth further aid for thy digestion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Open thy mind to that which I reveal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fix it there within; for ’tis not knowledge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The having heard without retaining it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the essence of this sacrifice two things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Convene together; and the one is that</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which ’tis made, the other is the agreement.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This last for evermore is cancelled not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless complied with, and concerning this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such precision has above been spoken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To offer still, though sometimes what was offered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might be commuted, as thou ought’st to know.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other, which is known to thee as matter,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1267" id="noteref-1267" epub:type="noteref">1267</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May well indeed be such that one errs not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If it for other matter be exchanged.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But let none shift the burden on his shoulder</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At his arbitrament, without the turning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of the white and of the yellow key;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1268" id="noteref-1268" epub:type="noteref">1268</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every permutation deem as foolish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If in the substitute the thing relinquished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As the four is in six, be not contained.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1269" id="noteref-1269" epub:type="noteref">1269</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore whatever thing has so great weight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In value that it drags down every balance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cannot be satisfied with other spending.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let mortals never take a vow in jest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be faithful and not blind in doing that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Jephthah was in his first offering,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1270" id="noteref-1270" epub:type="noteref">1270</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom more beseemed to say, ‘I have done wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1271" id="noteref-1271" epub:type="noteref">1271</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1272" id="noteref-1272" epub:type="noteref">1272</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made for her both wise and simple weep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Christians, be ye more serious in your movements;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be ye not like a feather at each wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And think not every water washes you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have the Old and the New Testament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let this suffice you unto your salvation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If evil appetite cry aught else to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1273" id="noteref-1273" epub:type="noteref">1273</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the Jew among you may not mock you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1274" id="noteref-1274" epub:type="noteref">1274</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its mother’s milk, and frolicsome and simple</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Combats at its own pleasure with itself.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then all desireful turned herself again</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To that part where the world is most alive.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1275" id="noteref-1275" epub:type="noteref">1275</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her silence and her change of countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Silence imposed upon my eager mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had already in advance new questions;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as an arrow that upon the mark</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did we speed into the second realm.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Lady there so joyful I beheld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1276" id="noteref-1276" epub:type="noteref">1276</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More luminous thereat the planet grew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if the star itself was changed and smiled,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1277" id="noteref-1277" epub:type="noteref">1277</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What became I, who by my nature am</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exceeding mutable in every guise!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As, in a fishpond which is pure and tranquil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fishes draw to that which from without</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I beheld more than a thousand splendors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Lo, this is she who shall increase our love.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as each one was coming unto us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full of beatitude the shade was seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the effulgence clear that issued from it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1278" id="noteref-1278" epub:type="noteref">1278</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An agonizing need of knowing more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of thyself thou’lt see how I from these</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was in desire of hearing their conditions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As they unto mine eyes were manifest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou wellborn, unto whom Grace concedes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With light that through the whole of heaven is spread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus by someone among those holy spirits<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1279" id="noteref-1279" epub:type="noteref">1279</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was spoken, and by Beatrice: “Speak, speak</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Securely, and believe them even as Gods.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spirit august, thy station in the sphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That veils itself to men in alien rays.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1280" id="noteref-1280" epub:type="noteref">1280</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This said I in direction of the light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which first had spoken to me; whence it became</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By far more lucent than it was before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1281" id="noteref-1281" epub:type="noteref">1281</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By too much light, when heat has worn away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The tempering influence of the vapors dense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By greater rapture thus concealed itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In its own radiance the figure saintly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thus close, close enfolded answered me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In fashion as the following Canto sings.</span>

					<span class="i1">Each contradiction to be false and true.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as with the Church I moved my feet,</span>

					<span>Whereby the human species down below</span>

					<span>To where the nature, which from its own Maker</span>

					<span class="i1">Wherefore this mode was worthiest will I say.</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>The more conformed thereto, the more it pleases;</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">From his nobility he needs must fall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And render him unlike the Good Supreme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he little with its light is blanched,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to his dignity no more returns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless he fill up where transgression empties</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With righteous pains for criminal delights.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your nature when it sinned so utterly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In its own seed, out of these dignities</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as out of Paradise was driven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor could itself recover, if thou notest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With nicest subtlety, by anyway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Except by passing one of these two fords:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Either that God through clemency alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had pardon granted, or that man himself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had satisfaction for his folly made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fix now thine eye deep into the abyss</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the eternal counsel, to my speech</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far as may be fastened steadfastly!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Man in his limitations had not power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To satisfy, not having power to sink</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In his humility obeying then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far as he disobeying thought to rise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for this reason man has been from power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of satisfying by himself excluded.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore it God behoved in his own ways</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Man to restore unto his perfect life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I say in one, or else in both of them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since the action of the doer is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much more grateful, as it more presents</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The goodness of the heart from which it issues,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Goodness Divine, that doth imprint the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has been contented to proceed by each</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all its ways to lift you up again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ’twixt the first day and the final night</span>

					<span class="i1">Such high and such magnificent proceeding</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By one or by the other was or shall be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For God more bounteous was himself to give</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make man able to uplift himself,</span>

					<span class="i1">In which thou art, created may be called</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Just as they are in their entire existence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all the elements which thou hast named,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all those things which out of them are made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a created virtue are informed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Created was the matter which they have;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Created was the informing influence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within these stars that round about them go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soul of every brute and of the plants</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By its potential temperament attracts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ray and motion of the holy lights;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But your own life immediately inspires<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1334" id="noteref-1334" epub:type="noteref">1334</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Supreme Beneficence, and enamours it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So with herself, it evermore desires her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou from this mayst argue furthermore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your resurrection, if thou think again</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How human flesh was fashioned at that time</span>
					<br/>

					<span>I was not ware of our ascending to it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of our being in it gave full faith</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Lady whom I saw more beauteous grow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as within a flame a spark is seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as within a voice a voice discerned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When one is steadfast, and one comes and goes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within that light beheld I other lamps</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Move in a circle, speeding more and less,</span>

					<span>From a cold cloud descended never winds,</span>

					<span class="i1">They would not laggard and impeded seem</span>

					<span class="i1">Seen come towards us, leaving the gyration</span>

					<span>And behind those that most in front appeared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sounded “Osanna!” so that never since</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To hear again was I without desire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then unto us more nearly one approached,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And it alone began: “We all are ready</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto thy pleasure, that thou joy in us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We turn around with the celestial Princes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1345" id="noteref-1345" epub:type="noteref">1345</a></span>

					<span class="i1">One gyre and one gyration and one thirst,</span>

					<span class="i1">A little quiet will not be less sweet.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After these eyes of mine themselves had offered<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1347" id="noteref-1347" epub:type="noteref">1347</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my Lady reverently, and she</span>

					<span>Back to the light they turned, which so great promise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made of itself, and “Say, who art thou?” was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My voice, imprinted with a great affection.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the new joy that superadded was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto its joys, as soon as I had spoken!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus changed, it said to me: “The world possessed me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1349" id="noteref-1349" epub:type="noteref">1349</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Like as a creature swathed in its own silk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Much didst thou love me, and thou hadst good reason;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For had I been below, I should have shown thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat beyond the foliage of my love.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“Because I do believe the lofty joy</span>

					<span class="i1">Thy speech infuses into me, my Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where every good thing doth begin and end<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1362" id="noteref-1362" epub:type="noteref">1362</a></span>

					<span class="i1">That gazing upon God thou dost discern it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glad hast thou made me; so make clear to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since speaking thou hast stirred me up to doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How from sweet seed can bitter issue forth.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This I to him; and he to me: “If I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can show to thee a truth, to what thou askest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy face thou’lt hold as thou dost hold thy back.</span>

					<span>The Good which all the realm thou art ascending<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1363" id="noteref-1363" epub:type="noteref">1363</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turns and contents, maketh its providence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be a power within these bodies vast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not alone the natures are foreseen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the mind that in itself is perfect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But they together with their preservation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Falls foreordained unto an end foreseen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a shaft directed to its mark.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that were not, the heaven which thou dost walk</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would in such manner its effects produce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they no longer would be arts, but ruins.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This cannot be, if the Intelligences</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That keep these stars in motion are not maimed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And maimed the First that has not made them perfect.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I: “Not so; for ’tis impossible</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nature tire, I see, in what is needful.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he again: “Now say, would it be worse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For men on earth were they not citizens?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1364" id="noteref-1364" epub:type="noteref">1364</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Yes,” I replied; “and here I ask no reason.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And can they be so, if below they live not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Diversely unto offices diverse?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No, if your master writeth well for you.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1365" id="noteref-1365" epub:type="noteref">1365</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So came he with deductions to this point;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then he concluded: “Therefore it behoves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The roots of your effects to be diverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence one is Solon born, another Xerxes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1366" id="noteref-1366" epub:type="noteref">1366</a></span>

					<span>Thence happens it that Esau differeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1368" id="noteref-1368" epub:type="noteref">1368</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In seed from Jacob; and Quirinus comes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1369" id="noteref-1369" epub:type="noteref">1369</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From sire so vile that he is given to Mars.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A generated nature its own way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would always make like its progenitors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If Providence divine were not triumphant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now that which was behind thee is before thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that thou know that I with thee am pleased,</span>

					<span class="i1">With a corollary will I mantle thee.</span>

					<span>And if the world below would fix its mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On the foundation which is laid by nature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pursuing that, ’twould have the people good.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>To have fashioned of themselves two signs in heaven,</span>

					<span class="i1">Of God’s own mendicant was told to me,</span>

					<span>Because that living Light, which from its fount<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1534" id="noteref-1534" epub:type="noteref">1534</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Effulgent flows, so that it disunites not</span>

					<span class="i1">From Him nor from the Love in them intrined,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through its own goodness reunites its rays<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1535" id="noteref-1535" epub:type="noteref">1535</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In nine subsistences, as in a mirror,</span>

					<span class="i1">Downward from act to act becoming such</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Things generated, which the heaven produces</span>

					<span class="i1">By its own motion, with seed and without.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neither their wax, nor that which tempers it,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1538" id="noteref-1538" epub:type="noteref">1538</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remains immutable, and hence beneath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ideal signet more and less shines through;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore it happens, that the selfsame tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After its kind bears worse and better fruit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ye are born with characters diverse.</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And were the heaven in its supremest virtue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The brilliance of the seal would all appear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But nature gives it evermore deficient,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the like manner working as the artist,</span>

					<span class="i1">Who has the skill of art and hand that trembles.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If then the fervent Love, the Vision clear,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1540" id="noteref-1540" epub:type="noteref">1540</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of primal Virtue do dispose and seal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perfection absolute is there acquired.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus was of old the earth created worthy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all and every animal perfection;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thus the Virgin was impregnate made;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that thine own opinion I commend,</span>

					<span class="i1">That human nature never yet has been,</span>

					<span class="i1">In judging, even as he is who doth count</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The corn in field or ever it be ripe.</span>

					<span>Because of the resemblance that was born</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his discourse and that of Beatrice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom, after him, it pleased thus to begin:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“This man has need (and does not tell you so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor with the voice, nor even in his thought)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of going to the root of one truth more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Declare unto him if the light wherewith</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blossoms your substance shall remain with you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eternally the same that it is now;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if it do remain, say in what manner,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After ye are again made visible,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It can be that it injure not your sight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As by a greater gladness urged and drawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They who are dancing in a ring sometimes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, at that orison devout and prompt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The holy circles a new joy displayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In their revolving and their wondrous song.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoso lamenteth him that here we die</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That we may live above, has never there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain.</span>

					<span class="i1">And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three several times was chanted by each one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among those spirits, with such melody</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That for all merit it were just reward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, in the lustre most divine of all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1558" id="noteref-1558" epub:type="noteref">1558</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as perhaps the Angel’s was to Mary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answer: “As long as the festivity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Paradise shall be, so long our love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its brightness is proportioned to the ardor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ardor to the vision; and the vision</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Equals what grace it has above its worth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, glorious and sanctified, our flesh</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is reassumed, then shall our persons be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More pleasing by their being all complete;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For will increase whate’er bestows on us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Light which enables us to look on Him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore the vision must perforce increase,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Increase the ardor which from that is kindled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Increase the radiance which from this proceeds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But even as a coal that sends forth flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that its own appearance it maintains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall be o’erpowered in aspect by the flesh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which still today the earth doth cover up;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor can so great a splendor weary us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For strong will be the organs of the body</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To everything which hath the power to please us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sudden and alert appeared to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both one and the other choir to say Amen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That well they showed desire for their dead bodies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fathers, and the rest who had been dear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever they became eternal flames.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! all round about of equal brightness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Arose a lustre over what was there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like an horizon that is clearing up.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as at rise of early eve begin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the welkin new appearances,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the sight seems real and unreal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed to me that new subsistences<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1559" id="noteref-1559" epub:type="noteref">1559</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began there to be seen, and make a circle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Outside the other two circumferences.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O very sparkling of the Holy Spirit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How sudden and incandescent it became</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto mine eyes, that vanquished bore it not!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Beatrice so beautiful and smiling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appeared to me, that with the other sights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That followed not my memory I must leave her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The power, and I beheld myself translated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To higher salvation with my Lady only.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well was I ware that I was more uplifted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the enkindled smiling of the star,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1560" id="noteref-1560" epub:type="noteref">1560</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seemed to me more ruddy than its wont.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1561" id="noteref-1561" epub:type="noteref">1561</a></span>

					<span>With all my heart, and in that dialect<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1562" id="noteref-1562" epub:type="noteref">1562</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is the same in all, such holocaust</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To God I made as the new grace beseemed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not yet from my bosom was exhausted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ardor of sacrifice, before I knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This offering was accepted and auspicious;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For with so great a lustre and so red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Splendors appeared to me in twofold rays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said: “O Helios who dost so adorn them!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1563" id="noteref-1563" epub:type="noteref">1563</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as distinct with less and greater lights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Glimmers between the two poles of the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Galaxy that maketh wise men doubt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1564" id="noteref-1564" epub:type="noteref">1564</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus constellated in the depths of Mars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those rays described the venerable sign<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1565" id="noteref-1565" epub:type="noteref">1565</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That quadrants joining in a circle make.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here doth my memory overcome my genius;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1566" id="noteref-1566" epub:type="noteref">1566</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that I cannot find ensample worthy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he who takes his cross and follows Christ</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Again will pardon me what I omit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing in that aurora lighten Christ.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From horn to horn, and ’twixt the top and base,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1567" id="noteref-1567" epub:type="noteref">1567</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lights were in motion, brightly scintillating</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As they together met and passed each other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus level and aslant and swift and slow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1568" id="noteref-1568" epub:type="noteref">1568</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We here behold, renewing still the sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The particles of bodies long and short,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Across the sunbeam move, wherewith is listed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes the shade, which for their own defence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">People with cunning and with art contrive.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a lute and harp, accordant strung</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With many strings, a dulcet tinkling make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To him by whom the notes are not distinguished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from the lights that there to me appeared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upgathered through the cross a melody,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which rapt me, not distinguishing the hymn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well was I ware it was of lofty laud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because there came to me, “Arise and conquer!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1569" id="noteref-1569" epub:type="noteref">1569</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As unto him who hears and comprehends not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So much enamoured I became therewith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That until then there was not anything</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That e’er had fettered me with such sweet bonds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Postponing the delight of those fair eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into which gazing my desire has rest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But who bethinks him that the living seals<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1570" id="noteref-1570" epub:type="noteref">1570</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of every beauty grow in power ascending,</span>

					<span class="i1">And that I there had not turned round to those,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1571" id="noteref-1571" epub:type="noteref">1571</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can me excuse, if I myself accuse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To excuse myself, and see that I speak truly:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For here the holy joy is not disclosed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because ascending it becomes more pure.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1572" id="noteref-1572" epub:type="noteref">1572</a></span>

					<span>Silence imposed upon that dulcet lyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And quieted the consecrated chords,</span>

					<span class="i1">That Heaven’s right hand doth tighten and relax.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How unto just entreaties shall be deaf</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those substances, which, to give me desire</span>

					<span class="i1">Of praying them, with one accord grew silent?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis well that without end he should lament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who for the love of thing that doth not last</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eternally despoils him of that love!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As through the pure and tranquil evening air</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There shoots from time to time a sudden fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moving the eyes that steadfast were before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And seems to be a star that changeth place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Except that in the part where it is kindled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nothing is missed, and this endureth little;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from the horn that to the right extends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto that cross’s foot there ran a star</span>

					<span class="i1">Out of the constellation shining there;</span>

					<span class="i1">But down the radiant fillet ran along,</span>

					<span>Thus piteous did Anchises’ shade reach forward,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1576" id="noteref-1576" epub:type="noteref">1576</a></span>

					<span class="i1">If any faith our greatest Muse deserve,</span>

					<span>Thus that effulgence; whence I gave it heed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then round unto my Lady turned my sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on this side and that was stupefied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in her eyes was burning such a smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with mine own methought I touched the bottom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of my grace and of my Paradise!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, pleasant to the hearing and the sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The spirit joined to its beginning things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I understood not, so profound it spake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor did it hide itself from me by choice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by necessity; for its conception</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above the mark of mortals set itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the bow of burning sympathy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was so far slackened, that its speech descended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards the mark of our intelligence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first thing that was understood by me</span>

					<span class="i1">Was “Benedight be Thou, O Trine and One,</span>

					<span class="i1">Who hast unto my seed so courteous been!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it continued: “Hunger long and grateful,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1578" id="noteref-1578" epub:type="noteref">1578</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drawn from the reading of the mighty volume<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1579" id="noteref-1579" epub:type="noteref">1579</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Wherein is never changed the white nor dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast appeased, my son, within this light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which I speak to thee, by grace of her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who to this lofty flight with plumage clothed thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From Him who is the first, as from the unit,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1580" id="noteref-1580" epub:type="noteref">1580</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If that be known, ray out the five and six;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore who I am thou askest not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And why I seem more joyous unto thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than any other of this gladsome crowd.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou think’st the truth; because the small and great<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1581" id="noteref-1581" epub:type="noteref">1581</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of this existence look into the mirror</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein, before thou think’st, thy thought thou showest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that the sacred love, in which I watch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sight perpetual, and which makes me thirst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sweet desire, may better be fulfilled,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>To Beatrice I turned me, and she heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before I spake, and smiled to me a sign,</span>

					<span class="i1">That made the wings of my desire increase;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then in this wise began I: “Love and knowledge,</span>

					<span class="i1">By Beatrice and by the holy light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That first on my account had changed its place.</span>

					<span class="i1">Imprinted well with the internal stamp;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>While I was with Virgilius conjoined</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That unto me had spoken before; and even</span>

					<span class="i1">Ensnared themselves of old, ere yet was slain</span>

					<span class="i1">Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth.</span>

					<span>Thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1674" id="noteref-1674" epub:type="noteref">1674</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The bread of others, and how hard a road</span>

					<span class="i1">The going down and up another’s stairs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will be the bad and foolish company<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1675" id="noteref-1675" epub:type="noteref">1675</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Of their bestiality their own proceedings</span>

					<span class="i1">A party to have made thee by thyself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who on the Ladder bears the holy bird,</span>

					<span class="i1">That ’twixt you twain, in doing and in asking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That shall be first which is with others last.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him shalt thou see one who at his birth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1678" id="noteref-1678" epub:type="noteref">1678</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has by this star of strength been so impressed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That notable shall his achievements be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not yet the people are aware of him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through his young age, since only nine years yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Around about him have these wheels revolved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1679" id="noteref-1679" epub:type="noteref">1679</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In caring not for silver nor for toil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So recognized shall his magnificence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Become hereafter, that his enemies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On him rely, and on his benefits;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By him shall many people be transformed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Changing condition rich and mendicant;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him, but shalt not say it”⁠—and things said he</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Incredible to those who shall be present.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then added: “Son, these are the commentaries<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1680" id="noteref-1680" epub:type="noteref">1680</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On what was said to thee; behold the snares</span>

					<span class="i1">That are concealed behind few revolutions;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet would I not thy neighbors thou shouldst envy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because thy life into the future reaches</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond the punishment of their perfidies.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When by its silence showed that sainted soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it had finished putting in the woof</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into that web which I had given it warped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Began I, even as he who yearneth after,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being in doubt, some counsel from a person</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who seeth, and uprightly wills, and loves:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Well see I, father mine, how spurreth on</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The time towards me such a blow to deal me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As heaviest is to him who most gives way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore with foresight it is well I arm me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, if the dearest place be taken from me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I may not lose the others by my songs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down through the world of infinite bitterness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And o’er the mountain, from whose beauteous summit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The eyes of my own Lady lifted me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And afterward through heaven from light to light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I have learned that which, if I tell again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will be a savor of strong herbs to many.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if I am a timid friend to truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I fear lest I may lose my life with those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who will hereafter call this time the olden.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The light in which was smiling my own treasure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which there I had discovered, flashed at first</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then made reply: “A conscience overcast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or with its own or with another’s shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ne’ertheless, all falsehood laid aside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make manifest thy vision utterly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1681" id="noteref-1681" epub:type="noteref">1681</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And let them scratch wherever is the itch;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1682" id="noteref-1682" epub:type="noteref">1682</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if thine utterance shall offensive be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the first taste, a vital nutriment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twill leave thereafter, when it is digested.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This cry of thine shall do as doth the wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which smiteth most the most exalted summits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that is no slight argument of honor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore are shown to thee within these wheels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the mount and in the dolorous valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only the souls that unto fame are known;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because the spirit of the hearer rests not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor doth confirm its faith by an example</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which has the root of it unknown and hidden,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet,</span>

					<span class="i1">Said: “Change thy thought; consider that I am</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Not only that my language I distrust,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above itself, unless another guide it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus much upon that point can I repeat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, her again beholding, my affection</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From every other longing was released.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the eternal pleasure, which direct</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Contented me with its reflected aspect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Conquering me with the radiance of a smile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She said to me, “Turn thee about and listen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as sometimes here do we behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The affection in the look, if it be such</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the soul is wrapt away by it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, by the flaming of the effulgence holy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which I turned, I recognized therein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it began: “In this fifth resting-place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the tree that liveth by its summit,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1687" id="noteref-1687" epub:type="noteref">1687</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are blessed spirits that below, ere yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They came to Heaven, were of such great renown</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That every Muse therewith would affluent be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore look thou upon the cross’s horns;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He whom I now shall name will there enact</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What doth within a cloud its own swift fire.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw athwart the Cross a splendor drawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1688" id="noteref-1688" epub:type="noteref">1688</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor noted I the word before the deed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the name of the great Maccabee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1689" id="noteref-1689" epub:type="noteref">1689</a></span>

					<span class="i1">I saw another move itself revolving,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1691" id="noteref-1691" epub:type="noteref">1691</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two of them my regard attentive followed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As followeth the eye its falcon flying.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>William thereafterward, and Renouard,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1692" id="noteref-1692" epub:type="noteref">1692</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1693" id="noteref-1693" epub:type="noteref">1693</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1694" id="noteref-1694" epub:type="noteref">1694</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, moved and mingled with the other lights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The soul that had addressed me showed how great</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An artist ’twas among the heavenly singers.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To my right side I turned myself around,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My duty to behold in Beatrice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either by words or gesture signified;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so translucent I beheld her eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So full of pleasure, that her countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Surpassed its other and its latest wont.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as, by feeling greater delectation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A man in doing good from day to day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I became aware that my gyration</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With heaven together had increased its arc,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That miracle beholding more adorned.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1695" id="noteref-1695" epub:type="noteref">1695</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such as is the change, in little lapse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of time, in a pale woman, when her face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1696" id="noteref-1696" epub:type="noteref">1696</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within that Jovial torch did I behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sparkling of the love which was therein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Delineate our language to mine eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as birds uprisen from the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in congratulation o’er their food,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1697" id="noteref-1697" epub:type="noteref">1697</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from within those lights the holy creatures</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made of themselves now <b>d</b>, now <b>i</b>, now <b>l</b>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1698" id="noteref-1698" epub:type="noteref">1698</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>First singing they to their own music moved;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then one becoming of these characters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A little while they rested and were silent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O divine Pegasea, thou who genius<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1699" id="noteref-1699" epub:type="noteref">1699</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Illume me with thyself, that I may bring</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their figures out as I have them conceived!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Apparent be thy power in these brief verses!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Themselves then they displayed in five times seven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vowels and consonants; and I observed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The parts as they seemed spoken unto me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i xml:lang="la">Diligite justitiam</i>, these were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First verb and noun of all that was depicted;</span>

					<span class="i1"><i xml:lang="la">Qui judicatis terram</i> were the last.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1700" id="noteref-1700" epub:type="noteref">1700</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter in the <b>m</b> of the fifth word</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And other lights I saw descend where was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The summit of the <b>m</b>, and pause there singing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The good, I think, that draws them to itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, as in striking upon burning logs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1701" id="noteref-1701" epub:type="noteref">1701</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upward there fly innumerable sparks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence fools are wont to look for auguries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1702" id="noteref-1702" epub:type="noteref">1702</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to ascend, some more, and others less,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, each one being quiet in its place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The head and neck beheld I of an eagle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1703" id="noteref-1703" epub:type="noteref">1703</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Delineated by that inlaid fire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who there paints has none to be his guide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That virtue which is form unto the nest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1704" id="noteref-1704" epub:type="noteref">1704</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other beatitude, that contented seemed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1705" id="noteref-1705" epub:type="noteref">1705</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At first to bloom a lily on the <b>m</b>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a slight motion followed out the imprint.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O gentle star! what and how many gems</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that a second time it now be wroth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With buying and with selling in the temple</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1706" id="noteref-1706" epub:type="noteref">1706</a></span>

					<span class="i1">All gone astray after the bad example!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1707" id="noteref-1707" epub:type="noteref">1707</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well canst thou say: “So steadfast my desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is unto him who willed to live alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for a dance was led to martyrdom,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1710" id="noteref-1710" epub:type="noteref">1710</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The beautiful image that in sweet fruition</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made jubilant the interwoven souls;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appeared a little ruby each, wherein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That each into mine eyes refracted it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what it now behoves me to retrace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor voice has e’er reported, nor ink written,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor was by fantasy e’er comprehended;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And utter with its voice both <em>I</em> and <em>My</em>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When in conception it was <em>We</em> and <em>Our</em>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1712" id="noteref-1712" epub:type="noteref">1712</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it began: “Being just and merciful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Am I exalted here unto that glory</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which cannot be exceeded by desire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And upon earth I left my memory</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such, that the evil-minded people there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Commend it, but continue not the story.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So doth a single heat from many embers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make itself felt, even as from many loves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Issued a single sound from out that image.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I thereafter: “O perpetual flowers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the eternal joy, that only one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make me perceive your odors manifold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exhaling, break within me the great fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which a long season has in hunger held me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not finding for it any food on earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well do I know, that if in heaven its mirror<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1713" id="noteref-1713" epub:type="noteref">1713</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Justice Divine another realm doth make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yours apprehends it not through any veil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You know how I attentively address me</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is in me so very old a fast.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as a falcon, issuing from his hood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Showing desire, and making himself fine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw I become that standard, which of lauds<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1715" id="noteref-1715" epub:type="noteref">1715</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was interwoven of the grace divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such songs as he knows who there rejoices.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then it began: “He who a compass turned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1716" id="noteref-1716" epub:type="noteref">1716</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On the world’s outer verge, and who within it</span>

					<span class="i1">Devised so much occult and manifest,</span>

					<span class="i1">Should not remain in infinite excess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this makes certain that the first proud being,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who was the paragon of every creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By not awaiting light fell immature.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1718" id="noteref-1718" epub:type="noteref">1718</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hence appears it, that each minor nature<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1719" id="noteref-1719" epub:type="noteref">1719</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is scant receptacle unto that good</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which has no end, and by itself is measured.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In consequence our vision, which perforce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Must be some ray of that intelligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which all things whatever are replete,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1720" id="noteref-1720" epub:type="noteref">1720</a></span>

					<span>Cannot in its own nature be so potent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1721" id="noteref-1721" epub:type="noteref">1721</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it shall not its origin discern</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far beyond that which is apparent to it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore into the justice sempiternal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The power of vision that your world receives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As eye into the ocean, penetrates;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which, though it see the bottom near the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no light but comes from the serene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never is o’ercast, nay, it is darkness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1722" id="noteref-1722" epub:type="noteref">1722</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amply to thee is opened now the cavern</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which has concealed from thee the living justice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which thou mad’st such frequent questioning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For saidst thou: ‘Born a man is on the shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Indus, and is none who there can speak</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all his inclinations and his actions</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are good, so far as human reason sees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without a sin in life or in discourse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He dieth unbaptised and without faith;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where is this justice that condemneth him?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where is his fault, if he do not believe?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In judgment at a thousand miles away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the short vision of a single span?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truly to him who with me subtilizes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If so the Scripture were not over you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For doubting there were marvellous occasion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O animals terrene, O stolid minds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The primal will, that in itself is good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne’er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So much is just as is accordant with it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No good created draws it to itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But it, by raying forth, occasions that.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as above her nest goes circling round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The stork when she has fed her little ones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he who has been fed looks up at her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So lifted I my brows, and even such</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became the blessed image, which its wings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was moving, by so many counsels urged.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Circling around it sang, and said: “As are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My notes to thee, who dost not comprehend them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those lucent splendors of the Holy Spirit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grew quiet then, but still within the standard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That made the Romans reverend to the world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It recommenced: “Unto this kingdom never</span>

					<span class="i1">That on all sides the daylight is consumed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1747" id="noteref-1747" epub:type="noteref">1747</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heaven, that erst by him alone was kindled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth suddenly reveal itself again<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1748" id="noteref-1748" epub:type="noteref">1748</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By many lights, wherein is one resplendent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And came into my mind this act of heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When the ensign of the world and of its leaders</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had silent in the blessed beak become;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because those living luminaries all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By far more luminous, did songs begin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lapsing and falling from my memory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O gentle Love, that with a smile dost cloak thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How ardent in those sparks didst thou appear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had the breath alone of holy thoughts!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the precious and pellucid crystals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which begemmed the sixth light I beheld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Silence imposed on the angelic bells,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I seemed to hear the murmuring of a river</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That clear descendeth down from rock to rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Showing the affluence of its mountain-top.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as the sound upon the cithern’s neck</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Taketh its form, and as upon the vent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of rustic pipe the wind that enters it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus, relieved from the delay of waiting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That murmuring of the eagle mounted up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along its neck, as if it had been hollow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There it became a voice, and issued thence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From out its beak, in such a form of words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As the heart waited for wherein I wrote them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The part in me which sees and bears the sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In mortal eagles,” it began to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Now fixedly must needs be looked upon;</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became a Greek by ceding to the pastor;</span>

					<span class="i1">From his good action is not harmful to him,</span>

					<span class="i1">Although his sight may not discern the bottom.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like as a lark that in the air expatiates,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1758" id="noteref-1758" epub:type="noteref">1758</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First singing and then silent with content</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the last sweetness that doth satisfy her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such seemed to me the image of the imprint</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the eternal pleasure, by whose will</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth everything become the thing it is.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And notwithstanding to my doubt I was</span>

					<span class="i1">As glass is to the color that invests it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wait the time in silence it endured not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But forth from out my mouth, “What things are these?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Extorted with the force of its own weight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat I saw great joy of coruscation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafterward with eye still more enkindled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The blessed standard made to me reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To keep me not in wonderment suspended:</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that, although believed in, they are hidden.</span>

					<span class="i1">That overcometh the Divine volition;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not in the guise that man o’ercometh man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But conquers it because it will be conquered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And conquered conquers by benignity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first life of the eyebrow and the fifth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1761" id="noteref-1761" epub:type="noteref">1761</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cause thee astonishment, because with them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou seest the region of the angels painted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They passed not from their bodies, as thou thinkest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gentiles, but Christians in the steadfast faith</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of feet that were to suffer and had suffered.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1762" id="noteref-1762" epub:type="noteref">1762</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For one from Hell, where no one e’er turns back<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1763" id="noteref-1763" epub:type="noteref">1763</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto good will, returned unto his bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that of living hope was the reward⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of living hope, that placed its efficacy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In prayers to God made to resuscitate him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that ’twere possible to move his will.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1764" id="noteref-1764" epub:type="noteref">1764</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The glorious soul concerning which I speak,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1765" id="noteref-1765" epub:type="noteref">1765</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Returning to the flesh, where brief its stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Believed in Him who had the power to aid it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, in believing, kindled to such fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of genuine love, that at the second death</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Worthy it was to come unto this joy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other one, through grace, that from so deep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1766" id="noteref-1766" epub:type="noteref">1766</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A fountain wells that never hath the eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of any creature reached its primal wave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Set all his love below on righteousness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore from grace to grace did God unclose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His eye to our redemption yet to be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he believed therein, and suffered not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that day forth the stench of paganism,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he reproved therefor the folk perverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those Maidens three, whom at the right-hand wheel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1767" id="noteref-1767" epub:type="noteref">1767</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou didst behold, were unto him for baptism</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than a thousand years before baptizing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O thou predestination, how remote<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1768" id="noteref-1768" epub:type="noteref">1768</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy root is from the aspect of all those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who the First Cause do not behold entire!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you, O mortals! hold yourselves restrained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In judging; for ourselves, who look on God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We do not know as yet all the elect;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sweet to us is such a deprivation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because our good in this good is made perfect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That whatsoe’er God wills, we also will.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After this manner by that shape divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make clear in me my shortsightedness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was given to me a pleasant medicine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as good singer a good lutanist</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accompanies with vibrations of the chords,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby more pleasantness the song acquires,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, while it spake, do I remember me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I beheld both of those blessed lights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as the winking of the eyes concords,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Moving unto the words their little flames.</span>

					<span>Already on my Lady’s face mine eyes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1769" id="noteref-1769" epub:type="noteref">1769</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Again were fastened, and with these my mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from all other purpose was withdrawn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she smiled not; but “If I were to smile,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She unto me began, “thou wouldst become</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like Semele, when she was turned to ashes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1770" id="noteref-1770" epub:type="noteref">1770</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because my beauty, that along the stairs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the eternal palace more enkindles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou hast seen, the farther we ascend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If it were tempered not, is so resplendent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all thy mortal power in its effulgence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would seem a leaflet that the thunder crushes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We are uplifted to the seventh splendor,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1771" id="noteref-1771" epub:type="noteref">1771</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That underneath the burning Lion’s breast</span>

					<span class="i1">Now radiates downward mingled with his power.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fix in direction of thine eyes the mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And make of them a mirror for the figure</span>

					<br/>
					<span>He who could know what was the pasturage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My sight had in that blessed countenance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I transferred me to another care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would recognize how grateful was to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Obedience unto my celestial escort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By counterpoising one side with the other.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the crystal which, around the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Revolving, bears the name of its dear leader,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under whom every wickedness lay dead,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1772" id="noteref-1772" epub:type="noteref">1772</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Coloured like gold, on which the sunshine gleams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A stairway I beheld to such a height<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1773" id="noteref-1773" epub:type="noteref">1773</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uplifted, that mine eye pursued it not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Likewise beheld I down the steps descending</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So many splendors, that I thought each light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in the heaven appears was there diffused.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as accordant with their natural custom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rooks together at the break of day<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1774" id="noteref-1774" epub:type="noteref">1774</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then some of them fly off without return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Others come back to where they started from,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And others, wheeling round, still keep at home;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such fashion it appeared to me was there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the sparkling that together came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As soon as on a certain step it struck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that which nearest unto us remained<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1775" id="noteref-1775" epub:type="noteref">1775</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became so clear, that in my thought I said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Well I perceive the love thou showest me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But she, from whom I wait the how and when<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1776" id="noteref-1776" epub:type="noteref">1776</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of speech and silence, standeth still; whence I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against desire do well if I ask not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She thereupon, who saw my silentness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the sight of Him who seeth everything,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me, “Let loose thy warm desire.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I began: “No merit of my own</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Renders me worthy of response from thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But for her sake who granteth me the asking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In thy beatitude, make known to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cause which draweth thee so near my side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tell me why is silent in this wheel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dulcet symphony of Paradise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That through the rest below sounds so devoutly.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It answer made to me; “they sing not here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the same cause that Beatrice has not smiled.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1777" id="noteref-1777" epub:type="noteref">1777</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus far adown the holy stairway’s steps</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have I descended but to give thee welcome</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With words, and with the light that mantles me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor did more love cause me to be more ready,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For love as much and more up there is burning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As doth the flaming manifest to thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the high charity, that makes us servants</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prompt to the counsel which controls the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I see full well,” said I, “O sacred lamp!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How love unfettered in this court sufficeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To follow the eternal Providence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But this is what seems hard for me to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto this office from among thy consorts.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No sooner had I come to the last word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than of its middle made the light a centre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whirling itself about like a swift millstone.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1778" id="noteref-1778" epub:type="noteref">1778</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When answer made the love that was therein:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“On me directed is a light divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Piercing through this in which I am embosomed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lifts me above myself so far, I see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The supreme essence from which this is drawn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to my sight, as far as it is clear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The clearness of the flame I equal make.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1779" id="noteref-1779" epub:type="noteref">1779</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that soul in the heaven which is most pure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could this demand of thine not satisfy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because so deeply sinks in the abyss</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the eternal statute what thou askest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From all created sight it is cut off.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the mortal world, when thou returnest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This carry back, that it may not presume</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Longer tow’rd such a goal to move its feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mind, that shineth here, on earth doth smoke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From this observe how can it do below</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which it cannot though the heaven assume it?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such limit did its words prescribe to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The question I relinquished, and restricted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Myself to ask it humbly who it was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1780" id="noteref-1780" epub:type="noteref">1780</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not far distant from thy native place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So high, the thunders far below them sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And form a ridge that Catria is called,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Neath which is consecrate a hermitage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1781" id="noteref-1781" epub:type="noteref">1781</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wont to be dedicate to worship only.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus unto me the third speech recommenced,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1782" id="noteref-1782" epub:type="noteref">1782</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then, continuing, it said: “Therein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto God’s service I became so steadfast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That feeding only on the juice of olives</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Contented in my thoughts contemplative.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That cloister used to render to these heavens</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Abundantly, and now is empty grown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that perforce it soon must be revealed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I in that place was Peter Damiano;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1783" id="noteref-1783" epub:type="noteref">1783</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Peter the Sinner was I in the house<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1784" id="noteref-1784" epub:type="noteref">1784</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Little of mortal life remained to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I was called and dragged forth to the hat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1785" id="noteref-1785" epub:type="noteref">1785</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1786" id="noteref-1786" epub:type="noteref">1786</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Taking the food of any hostelry.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1787" id="noteref-1787" epub:type="noteref">1787</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now someone to support them on each side<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1788" id="noteref-1788" epub:type="noteref">1788</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So heavy are they, and to hold their trains.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that two beasts go underneath one skin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At this voice saw I many little flames</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From step to step descending and revolving,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every revolution made them fairer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Round about this one came they and stood still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And a cry uttered of so loud a sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It here could find no parallel, nor I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distinguished it, the thunder so o’ercame me.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1789" id="noteref-1789" epub:type="noteref">1789</a></span>

					<span>Oppressed with stupor, I unto my guide<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1790" id="noteref-1790" epub:type="noteref">1790</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned like a little child who always runs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For refuge there where he confideth most;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she, even as a mother who straightway</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With voice whose wont it is to reassure him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said to me: “Knowest thou not thou art in heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what is done here cometh from good zeal?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After what wise the singing would have changed thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I by smiling, thou canst now imagine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since that the cry has startled thee so much,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which if thou hadst understood its prayers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already would be known to thee the vengeance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sword above here smiteth not in haste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor tardily, howe’er it seem to him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who fearing or desiring waits for it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But turn thee round towards the others now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For very illustrious spirits shalt thou see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou thy sight directest as I say.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw a hundred spherules that together</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With mutual rays each other more embellished.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stood as one who in himself represses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The point of his desire, and ventures not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To question, he so feareth the too much.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now the largest and most luculent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among those pearls came forward, that it might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make my desire concerning it content.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within it then I heard: “If thou couldst see<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1791" id="noteref-1791" epub:type="noteref">1791</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as myself the charity that burns</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among us, thy conceits would be expressed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, that by waiting thou mayst not come late</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the high end, I will make answer even</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the thought of which thou art so chary.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That mountain on whose slope Cassino stands<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1792" id="noteref-1792" epub:type="noteref">1792</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was frequented of old upon its summit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a deluded folk and ill-disposed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I am he who first up thither bore<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1793" id="noteref-1793" epub:type="noteref">1793</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The name of Him who brought upon the earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The truth that so much sublimateth us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such abundant grace upon me shone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the neighboring towns I drew away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the impious worship that seduced the world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These other fires, each one of them, were men</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Contemplative, enkindled by that heat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here is Macarius, here is Romualdus,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1794" id="noteref-1794" epub:type="noteref">1794</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here are my brethren, who within the cloisters</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “The affection which thou showest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Speaking with me, and the good countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I behold and note in all your ardors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In me have so my confidence dilated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As the sun doth the rose, when it becomes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far unfolded as it hath the power.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I pray, and thou assure me, father,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I may so much grace receive, that I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May thee behold with countenance unveiled.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thereupon: “Brother, thy high desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where are fulfilled all others and my own.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There perfect is, and ripened, and complete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Every desire; within that one alone<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1795" id="noteref-1795" epub:type="noteref">1795</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is every part where it has always been;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it is not in space, nor turns on poles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And unto it our stairway reaches up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1796" id="noteref-1796" epub:type="noteref">1796</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Extending its supernal part, what time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So thronged with angels it appeared to him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to ascend it now no one uplifts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His feet from off the earth, and now my Rule</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Below remaineth for mere waste of paper.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1797" id="noteref-1797" epub:type="noteref">1797</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The walls that used of old to be an Abbey</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are changed to dens of robbers, and the cowls<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1798" id="noteref-1798" epub:type="noteref">1798</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are sacks filled full of miserable flour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But heavy usury is not taken up<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1799" id="noteref-1799" epub:type="noteref">1799</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much against God’s pleasure as that fruit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which maketh so insane the heart of monks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For whatsoever hath the Church in keeping</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is for the folk that ask it in God’s name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not for one’s kindred or for something worse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flesh of mortals is so very soft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That good beginnings down below suffice not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From springing of the oak to bearing acorns.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Peter began with neither gold nor silver,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I with orison and abstinence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Francis with humility his convent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if thou lookest at each one’s beginning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then regardest whither he has run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shalt behold the white changed into brown.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In verity the Jordan backward turned,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1800" id="noteref-1800" epub:type="noteref">1800</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the sea’s fleeing, when God willed were more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A wonder to behold, than succor here.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus unto me he said; and then withdrew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To his own band, and the band closed together;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gentle Lady urged me on behind them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up o’er that stairway by a single sign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did her virtue overcome my nature;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor here below, where one goes up and down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By natural law, was motion e’er so swift</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it could be compared unto my wing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reader, as I may unto that devout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Triumph return, on whose account I often<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1801" id="noteref-1801" epub:type="noteref">1801</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For my transgressions weep and beat my breast⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drawn it out again, before I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sign that follows Taurus, and was in it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1802" id="noteref-1802" epub:type="noteref">1802</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>O glorious stars, O light impregnated<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1803" id="noteref-1803" epub:type="noteref">1803</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All of my genius, whatsoe’er it be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With you was born, and hid himself with you,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1804" id="noteref-1804" epub:type="noteref">1804</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He who is father of all mortal life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When first I tasted of the Tuscan air;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then when grace was freely given to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To enter the high wheel which turns you round,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1805" id="noteref-1805" epub:type="noteref">1805</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your region was allotted unto me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To you devoutly at this hour my soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the stern pass that draws it to itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou art so near unto the last salvation,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus Beatrice began, “thou oughtest now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To have thine eves unclouded and acute;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore, ere thou enter farther in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Look down once more, and see how vast a world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou hast already put beneath thy feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that thy heart, as jocund as it may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Present itself to the triumphant throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I with my sight returned through one and all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sevenfold spheres, and I beheld this globe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1806" id="noteref-1806" epub:type="noteref">1806</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that opinion I approve as best</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which doth account it least; and he who thinks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of something else may truly be called just.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw the daughter of Latona shining<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1807" id="noteref-1807" epub:type="noteref">1807</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without that shadow, which to me was cause</span>

					<span class="i1">That once I had believed her rare and dense.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1808" id="noteref-1808" epub:type="noteref">1808</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The aspect of thy son, Hyperion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1809" id="noteref-1809" epub:type="noteref">1809</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here I sustained, and saw how move themselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Around and near him Maia and Dione.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1810" id="noteref-1810" epub:type="noteref">1810</a></span>

					<span>Thence there appeared the temperateness of Jove<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1811" id="noteref-1811" epub:type="noteref">1811</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twixt son and father, and to me was clear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The change that of their whereabout they make;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the seven made manifest to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How great they are, and eke how swift they are,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1812" id="noteref-1812" epub:type="noteref">1812</a></span>

					<span class="i1">To me revolving with the eternal Twins,</span>

					<span class="i1">Becoming larger, issue from itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that which it became cannot remember.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1822" id="noteref-1822" epub:type="noteref">1822</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hast thou become to tolerate my smile.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was as one who still retains the feeling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of a forgotten vision, and endeavors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vain to bring it back into his mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I this invitation heard, deserving</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of so much gratitude, it never fades</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the book that chronicles the past.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If at this moment sounded all the tongues</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Polyhymnia and her sisters made<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1823" id="noteref-1823" epub:type="noteref">1823</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most lubrical with their delicious milk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It would not reach, singing the holy smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how the holy aspect it illumed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore, representing Paradise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sacred poem must perforce leap over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a man who finds his way cut off;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of the mortal shoulder laden with it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should blame it not, if under this it tremble.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is no passage for a little boat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why doth my face so much enamour thee,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1824" id="noteref-1824" epub:type="noteref">1824</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to the garden fair thou turnest not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is the Rose in which the Word Divine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1825" id="noteref-1825" epub:type="noteref">1825</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became incarnate; there the lilies are<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1826" id="noteref-1826" epub:type="noteref">1826</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By whose perfume the good way was discovered.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was wholly ready, once again betook me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the battle of the feeble brows.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1827" id="noteref-1827" epub:type="noteref">1827</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in the sunshine, that unsullied streams</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine eyes with shadow covered o’er have seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So troops of splendors manifold I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Illumined from above with burning rays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beholding not the source of the effulgence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O power benignant that dost so imprint them!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1828" id="noteref-1828" epub:type="noteref">1828</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The name of that fair flower I e’er invoke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1829" id="noteref-1829" epub:type="noteref">1829</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Morning and evening utterly enthralled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1830" id="noteref-1830" epub:type="noteref">1830</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when in both mine eyes depicted were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The glory and greatness of the living star<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1831" id="noteref-1831" epub:type="noteref">1831</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which there excelleth, as it here excelled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Athwart the heavens a little torch descended<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1832" id="noteref-1832" epub:type="noteref">1832</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Formed in a circle like a coronal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Compared unto the sounding of that lyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1833" id="noteref-1833" epub:type="noteref">1833</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I am Angelic Love, that circle round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was the hostelry of our Desire;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1834" id="noteref-1834" epub:type="noteref">1834</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou followest thy Son, and mak’st diviner</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did the circulated melody</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seal itself up; and all the other lights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were making to resound the name of Mary.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The regal mantle of the volumes all<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1835" id="noteref-1835" epub:type="noteref">1835</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that world, which most fervid is and living</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With breath of God and with his works and ways,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Extended over us its inner border,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1836" id="noteref-1836" epub:type="noteref">1836</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So very distant, that the semblance of it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where I was not yet appeared to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of following the incoronated flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which mounted upward near to its own seed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1837" id="noteref-1837" epub:type="noteref">1837</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a little child, that towards its mother</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through impulse kindled into outward flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So with its summit, that the deep affection</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They had for Mary was revealed to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter they remained there in my sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1"><i xml:lang="la">Regina cœli</i> singing with such sweetness,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1838" id="noteref-1838" epub:type="noteref">1838</a></span>

					<span class="i1">That ne’er from me has the delight departed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O, what exuberance is garnered up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within those richest coffers, which had been</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Good husbandmen for sowing here below!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There they enjoy and live upon the treasure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was acquired while weeping in the exile</span>

					<span>There triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of God and Mary, in his victory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both with the ancient council and the new,</span>

					<span>“O company elect to the great supper<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1841" id="noteref-1841" epub:type="noteref">1841</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the Lamb benedight, who feedeth you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that forever full is your desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If by the grace of God this man foretaste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Something of that which falleth from your table,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever death prescribe to him the time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Direct your mind to his immense desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him somewhat bedew; ye drinking are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forever at the fount whence comes his thought.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus Beatrice; and those souls beatified</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flaming intensely in the guise of comets.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as the wheels in works of horologes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Revolve so that the first to the beholder</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Motionless seems, and the last one to fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So in like manner did those carols, dancing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1842" id="noteref-1842" epub:type="noteref">1842</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In different measure, of their affluence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1843" id="noteref-1843" epub:type="noteref">1843</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give me the gauge, as they were swift or slow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From that one which I noted of most beauty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1844" id="noteref-1844" epub:type="noteref">1844</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld I issue forth a fire so happy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1845" id="noteref-1845" epub:type="noteref">1845</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That none it left there of a greater brightness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And around Beatrice three several times<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1846" id="noteref-1846" epub:type="noteref">1846</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It whirled itself with so divine a song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My fantasy repeats it not to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore the pen skips, and I write it not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since our imagination for such folds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Much more our speech, is of a tint too glaring.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1847" id="noteref-1847" epub:type="noteref">1847</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O holy sister mine, who us implorest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1848" id="noteref-1848" epub:type="noteref">1848</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such devotion, by thine ardent love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my Lady did direct its breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which spake in fashion as I here have said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she: “O light eterne of the great man</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom our Lord delivered up the keys</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He carried down of this miraculous joy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one examine on points light and grave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As good beseemeth thee, about the Faith</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By means of which thou on the sea didst walk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he love well, and hope well, and believe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From thee ’tis hid not; for thou hast thy sight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1849" id="noteref-1849" epub:type="noteref">1849</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where depicted everything is seen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since this kingdom has made citizens</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By means of the true Faith, to glorify it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis well he have the chance to speak thereof.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As baccalaureate arms himself, and speaks not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the master doth propose the question,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To argue it, and not to terminate it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did I arm myself with every reason,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While she was speaking, that I might be ready</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For such a questioner and such profession.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What is the Faith?” Whereat I raised my brow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then turned I round to Beatrice, and she</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prompt signals made to me that I should pour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The water forth from my internal fountain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“May grace, that suffers me to make confession,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began I, “to the great centurion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1850" id="noteref-1850" epub:type="noteref">1850</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cause my conceptions all to be explicit!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I continued: “As the truthful pen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Father, of thy dear brother wrote of it,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1851" id="noteref-1851" epub:type="noteref">1851</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who put with thee Rome into the good way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faith is the substance of the things we hope for,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1852" id="noteref-1852" epub:type="noteref">1852</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evidence of those that are not seen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this appears to me its quiddity.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1853" id="noteref-1853" epub:type="noteref">1853</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then heard I: “Very rightly thou perceivest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If well thou understandest why he placed it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With substances and then with evidences.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I thereafterward: “The things profound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That here vouchsafe to me their apparition,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto all eyes below are so concealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they exist there only in belief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the which is founded the high hope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hence it takes the nature of a substance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it behoveth us from this belief</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To reason without having other sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hence it has the nature of evidence.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1854" id="noteref-1854" epub:type="noteref">1854</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then heard I: “If whatever is acquired</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Below by doctrine were thus understood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No sophist’s subtlety would there find place.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then added: “Very well has been gone over</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already of this coin the alloy and weight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I: “Yes, both so shining and so round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in its stamp there is no peradventure.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1855" id="noteref-1855" epub:type="noteref">1855</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter issued from the light profound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That there resplendent was: “This precious jewel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the which is every virtue founded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence hadst thou it?” And I: “The large outpouring</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the ancient parchments and the new,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1856" id="noteref-1856" epub:type="noteref">1856</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A syllogism is, which proved it to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such acuteness, that, compared therewith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All demonstration seems to me obtuse.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then I heard: “The ancient and the new</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why dost thou take them for the word divine?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “The proofs, which show the truth to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne’er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas answered me: “Say, who assureth thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That those works ever were? the thing itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Were the world to Christianity converted,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said, “withouten miracles, this one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the field to sow there the good plant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was a vine and has become a thorn!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This being finished, the high, holy Court</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Resounded through the spheres, “One God we praise!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In melody that there above is chanted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then that Baron, who from branch to branch,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1857" id="noteref-1857" epub:type="noteref">1857</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Examining, had thus conducted me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till the extremest leaves we were approaching,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Again began: “The Grace that dallying<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1858" id="noteref-1858" epub:type="noteref">1858</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up to this point, as it should opened be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that I do approve what forth emerged;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But now thou must express what thou believest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whence to thy belief it was presented.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O holy father, spirit who beholdest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What thou believedst so that thou o’ercamest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1859" id="noteref-1859" epub:type="noteref">1859</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Began I, “thou dost wish me in this place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The form to manifest of my prompt belief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I respond: In one God I believe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With love and with desire, himself unmoved;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1860" id="noteref-1860" epub:type="noteref">1860</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of such faith not only have I proofs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Physical and metaphysical, but gives them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Likewise the truth that from this place rains down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>With the profound condition and divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind</span>

					<span class="i1">Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This the beginning is, this is the spark</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His servant straight embraces, gratulating</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the good news as soon as he is silent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, giving me its benediction, singing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three times encircled me, when I was silent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1863" id="noteref-1863" epub:type="noteref">1863</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which both heaven and earth have set their hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it many a year hath made me lean,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’ercome the cruelty that bars me out</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the fair sheepfold, where a lamb I slumbered,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1865" id="noteref-1865" epub:type="noteref">1865</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An enemy to the wolves that war upon it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With other voice forthwith, with other fleece<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1866" id="noteref-1866" epub:type="noteref">1866</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Poet will I return, and at my font<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1867" id="noteref-1867" epub:type="noteref">1867</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Baptismal will I take the laurel crown;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because into the Faith that maketh known</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All souls to God there entered I, and then</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Peter for her sake thus my brow encircled.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1868" id="noteref-1868" epub:type="noteref">1868</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafterward towards us moved a light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of that band whence issued the first-fruits<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1869" id="noteref-1869" epub:type="noteref">1869</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of his vicars Christ behind him left,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then my Lady, full of ecstasy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me: “Look, look! behold the Baron<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1870" id="noteref-1870" epub:type="noteref">1870</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For whom below Galicia is frequented.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the same way as, when a dove alights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Near his companion, both of them pour forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Circling about and murmuring, their affection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So one beheld I by the other grand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lauding the food that there above is eaten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when their gratulations were complete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Silently <i xml:lang="la">coram me</i> each one stood still,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1871" id="noteref-1871" epub:type="noteref">1871</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So incandescent it o’ercame my sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1872" id="noteref-1872" epub:type="noteref">1872</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of our Basilica have been described,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make Hope resound within this altitude;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1873" id="noteref-1873" epub:type="noteref">1873</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness.”⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1874" id="noteref-1874" epub:type="noteref">1874</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For what comes hither from the mortal world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Must needs be ripened in our radiance.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1875" id="noteref-1875" epub:type="noteref">1875</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This comfort came to me from the second fire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1876" id="noteref-1876" epub:type="noteref">1876</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which bent them down before with too great weight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the most secret chamber, with his Counts,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1877" id="noteref-1877" epub:type="noteref">1877</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that, the truth beholden of this court,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hope, which below there rightfully enamours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say what it is, and how is flowering with it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus did the second light again continue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Compassionate, who piloted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1878" id="noteref-1878" epub:type="noteref">1878</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The plumage of my wings in such high flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did in reply anticipate me thus:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“No child whatever the Church Militant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of greater hope possesses, as is written</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In that Sun which irradiates all our band;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1879" id="noteref-1879" epub:type="noteref">1879</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To come into Jerusalem to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever yet his warfare be completed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The two remaining points, that not for knowledge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1880" id="noteref-1880" epub:type="noteref">1880</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have been demanded, but that he report</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him I leave; for hard he will not find them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1881" id="noteref-1881" epub:type="noteref">1881</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And may the grace of God in this assist him!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As a disciple, who his teacher follows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ready and willing, where he is expert,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That his proficiency may be displayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hope,” said I, “is the certain expectation<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1882" id="noteref-1882" epub:type="noteref">1882</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of future glory, which is the effect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of grace divine and merit precedent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From many stars this light comes unto me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he instilled it first into my heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1883" id="noteref-1883" epub:type="noteref">1883</a></span>

					<span class="i1">He sayeth, ‘those who know thy name’; and who</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou didst instil me, then, with his instilling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the Epistle, so that I am full,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And upon others rain again your rain.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1885" id="noteref-1885" epub:type="noteref">1885</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>While I was speaking, in the living bosom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then breathed: “The love wherewith I am inflamed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards the virtue still which followed me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the palm and issue of the field,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1886" id="noteref-1886" epub:type="noteref">1886</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In her; and grateful to me is thy telling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whatever things Hope promises to thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “The ancient Scriptures and the new</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mark establish, and this shows it me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1887" id="noteref-1887" epub:type="noteref">1887</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1888" id="noteref-1888" epub:type="noteref">1888</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Isaiah saith, that each one garmented<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1889" id="noteref-1889" epub:type="noteref">1889</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In his own land shall be with twofold garments,</span>

					<span class="i1">And his own land is this delightful life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy brother, too, far more explicitly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where he treateth of the robes of white,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1890" id="noteref-1890" epub:type="noteref">1890</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This revelation manifests to us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And first, and near the ending of these words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Sperent in te</i>” from over us was heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which responsive answered all the carols.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafterward a light among them brightened,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1891" id="noteref-1891" epub:type="noteref">1891</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1892" id="noteref-1892" epub:type="noteref">1892</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Winter would have a month of one sole day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A winsome maiden, only to do honor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the new bride, and not from any failing,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1893" id="noteref-1893" epub:type="noteref">1893</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus did I behold the brightened splendor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1894" id="noteref-1894" epub:type="noteref">1894</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As was beseeming to their ardent love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the song and music there it entered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a bride silent and motionless.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“This is the one who lay upon the breast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him our Pelican; and this is he<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1895" id="noteref-1895" epub:type="noteref">1895</a></span>

					<span class="i1">To the great office from the cross elected.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1896" id="noteref-1896" epub:type="noteref">1896</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Lady thus; but therefore none the more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did move her sight from its attentive gaze</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before or afterward these words of hers.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as a man who gazes, and endeavors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I became before that latest fire,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1897" id="noteref-1897" epub:type="noteref">1897</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While it was said, “Why dost thou daze thyself</span>

					<span class="i1">To see a thing which here hath no existence?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all the others there, until our number</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the eternal proposition tallies.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1898" id="noteref-1898" epub:type="noteref">1898</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the two garments in the blessed cloister<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1899" id="noteref-1899" epub:type="noteref">1899</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are the two lights alone that have ascended:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1900" id="noteref-1900" epub:type="noteref">1900</a></span>

					<span class="i1">And this shalt thou take back into your world.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at this utterance the flaming circle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grew quiet, with the dulcet intermingling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of sound that by the trinal breath was made,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1901" id="noteref-1901" epub:type="noteref">1901</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The oars that erst were in the water beaten</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are all suspended at a whistle’s sound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, how much in my mind was I disturbed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I turned round to look on Beatrice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That her I could not see, although I was<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1902" id="noteref-1902" epub:type="noteref">1902</a></span>

					<span class="i1">By reason of the visual spirit that runs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the splendor passed from coat to coat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he who wakes abhorreth what he sees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So all unconscious is his sudden waking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the judgment cometh to his aid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from before mine eyes did Beatrice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Chase every mote with radiance of her own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That cast its light a thousand miles and more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence better after than before I saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in a kind of wonderment I asked</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About a fourth light that I saw with us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said my Lady: “There within those rays</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gazes upon its Maker the first soul<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1914" id="noteref-1914" epub:type="noteref">1914</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever the first virtue did create.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the bough that downward bends its top</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At transit of the wind, and then is lifted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By its own virtue, which inclines it upward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being amazed, and then I was made bold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a desire to speak wherewith I burned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I began: “O apple, that mature<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1915" id="noteref-1915" epub:type="noteref">1915</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Alone hast been produced, O ancient father,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom each wife is daughter and daughter-in-law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Devoutly as I can I supplicate thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thou wouldst speak to me; thou seest my wish;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I, to hear thee quickly, speak it not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes an animal, when covered, struggles</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that his impulse needs must be apparent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason of the wrappage following it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in like manner the primeval soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made clear to me athwart its covering</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then breathed: “Without thy uttering it to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine inclination better I discern</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I behold it in the truthful mirror,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of Himself all things parhelion makes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1916" id="noteref-1916" epub:type="noteref">1916</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And none makes Him parhelion of itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the lofty garden, where this Lady</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto so long a stairway thee disposed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of the great disdain the proper cause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the language that I used and that I made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, son of mine, the tasting of the tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not in itself was cause of so great exile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But solely the o’erstepping of the bounds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, whence thy Lady moved Virgilius,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1917" id="noteref-1917" epub:type="noteref">1917</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Four thousand and three hundred and two circuits</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made by the sun, this Council I desired;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him I saw return to all the lights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The language that I spake was quite extinct<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1918" id="noteref-1918" epub:type="noteref">1918</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before that in the work interminable</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of miserable mortals was unfolded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By her who doth imparadise my mind,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1966" id="noteref-1966" epub:type="noteref">1966</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in a looking-glass a taper’s flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He sees who from behind is lighted by it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before he has it in his sight or thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turns him round to see if so the glass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell him the truth, and sees that it accords</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therewith as doth a music with its metre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In similar wise my memory recollecteth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I did, looking into those fair eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which Love made the springes to ensnare me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as I turned me round, and mine were touched</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By that which is apparent in that volume,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1967" id="noteref-1967" epub:type="noteref">1967</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whenever on its gyre we gaze intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A point beheld I, that was raying out<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1968" id="noteref-1968" epub:type="noteref">1968</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Light so acute, the sight which it enkindles</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Must close perforce before such great acuteness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whatsoever star seems smallest here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would seem to be a moon, if placed beside it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one star with another star is placed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps at such a distance as appears</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A halo cincturing the light that paints it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When densest is the vapor that sustains it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus distant round the point a circle of fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So swiftly whirled, that it would have surpassed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whatever motion soonest girds the world;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this was by another circumcinct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That by a third, the third then by a fourth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a fifth the fourth, and then by a sixth the fifth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The seventh followed thereupon in width</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So ample now, that Juno’s messenger<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1969" id="noteref-1969" epub:type="noteref">1969</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Entire would be too narrow to contain it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even so the eighth and ninth; and everyone<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1970" id="noteref-1970" epub:type="noteref">1970</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More slowly moved, according as it was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In number distant farther from the first.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that one had its flame most crystalline</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From which less distant was the stainless spark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I think because more with its truth imbued.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Lady, who in my anxiety</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld me much perplexed, said: “From that point</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dependent is the heaven and nature all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold that circle most conjoined to it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And know thou, that its motion is so swift</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through burning love whereby it is spurred on.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to her: “If the world were arranged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the order which I see in yonder wheels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What’s set before me would have satisfied me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in the world of sense we can perceive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That evermore the circles are diviner</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As they are from the centre more remote</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore if my desire is to be ended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In this miraculous and angelic temple,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That has for confines only love and light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hear behoves me still how the example<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1971" id="noteref-1971" epub:type="noteref">1971</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the exemplar go not in one fashion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since for myself in vain I contemplate it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If thine own fingers unto such a knot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be insufficient, it is no great wonder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So hard hath it become for want of trying.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1972" id="noteref-1972" epub:type="noteref">1972</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Lady thus; then said she: “Do thou take</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What I shall tell thee, if thou wouldst be sated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And exercise on that thy subtlety.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The circles corporal are wide and narrow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1973" id="noteref-1973" epub:type="noteref">1973</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According to the more or less of virtue</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is distributed through all their parts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The greater goodness works the greater weal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The greater weal the greater body holds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If perfect equally are all its parts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore this one which sweeps along with it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1974" id="noteref-1974" epub:type="noteref">1974</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The universe sublime, doth correspond</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the circle which most loves and knows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which account, if thou unto the virtue</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Apply thy measure, not to the appearance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of substances that unto thee seem round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of more to greater, and of less to smaller,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1975" id="noteref-1975" epub:type="noteref">1975</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In every heaven, with its Intelligence.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as remaineth splendid and serene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hemisphere of air, when Boreas<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1976" id="noteref-1976" epub:type="noteref">1976</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is blowing from that cheek where he is mildest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because is purified and resolved the rack</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That erst disturbed it, till the welkin laughs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all the beauties of its pageantry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did I likewise, after that my Lady</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had me provided with her clear response,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And like a star in heaven the truth was seen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And soon as to a stop her words had come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not otherwise does iron scintillate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When molten, than those circles scintillated.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1977" id="noteref-1977" epub:type="noteref">1977</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their coruscation all the sparks repeated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they so many were, their number makes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More millions than the doubling of the chess.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1978" id="noteref-1978" epub:type="noteref">1978</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard them sing hosanna choir by choir</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the fixed point which holds them at the <i xml:lang="la">Ubi</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1979" id="noteref-1979" epub:type="noteref">1979</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ever will, where they have ever been.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she, who saw the dubious meditations</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within my mind, “The primal circles,” said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Have shown thee Seraphim and Cherubim.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1980" id="noteref-1980" epub:type="noteref">1980</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus rapidly they follow their own bonds,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1981" id="noteref-1981" epub:type="noteref">1981</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be as like the point as most they can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And can as far as they are high in vision.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those other Loves, that round about them go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrones of the countenance divine are called,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1982" id="noteref-1982" epub:type="noteref">1982</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because they terminate the primal Triad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou shouldst know that they all have delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much as their own vision penetrates</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Truth, in which all intellect finds rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From this it may be seen how blessedness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is founded in the faculty which sees,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1983" id="noteref-1983" epub:type="noteref">1983</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not in that which loves, and follows next;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of this seeing merit is the measure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is brought forth by grace, and by good will;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1984" id="noteref-1984" epub:type="noteref">1984</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The second Triad, which is germinating</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In such wise in this sempiternal spring,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1985" id="noteref-1985" epub:type="noteref">1985</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That no nocturnal Aries despoils,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perpetually hosanna warbles forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With threefold melody, that sounds in three</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Orders of joy, with which it is intrined.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The three Divine are in this hierarchy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First the Dominions, and the Virtues next;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1986" id="noteref-1986" epub:type="noteref">1986</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the third order is that of the Powers.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then in the dances twain penultimate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Principalities and Archangels wheel;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The last is wholly of angelic sports.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These orders upward all of them are gazing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And downward so prevail, that unto God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They all attracted are and all attract.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Dionysius with so great desire<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1987" id="noteref-1987" epub:type="noteref">1987</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To contemplate these Orders set himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He named them and distinguished them as I do.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Gregory afterwards dissented from him;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1988" id="noteref-1988" epub:type="noteref">1988</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore, as soon as he unclosed his eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within this heaven, he at himself did smile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if so much of secret truth a mortal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proffered on earth, I would not have thee marvel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he who saw it here revealed it to him,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1989" id="noteref-1989" epub:type="noteref">1989</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With much more of the truth about these circles.”</span>

					<span class="i1">Created a long lapse of centuries</span>

					<span>The rest remained, and they began this art</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which thou discernest, with so great delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never from their circling do they cease.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The occasion of the fall was the accursed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Presumption of that One, whom thou hast seen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2011" id="noteref-2011" epub:type="noteref">2011</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By all the burden of the world constrained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those whom thou here beholdest modest were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To recognise themselves as of that goodness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which made them apt for so much understanding;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which account their vision was exalted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the enlightening grace and their own merit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that they have a full and steadfast will.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would not have thee doubt, but certain be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis meritorious to receive this grace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2012" id="noteref-2012" epub:type="noteref">2012</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They teach that such is the angelic nature</span>

					<span>More will I say, that thou mayst see unmixed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The truth that is confounded there below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Equivocating in suchlike prelections.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These substances, since in God’s countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They jocund were, turned not away their sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that wherefrom not anything is hidden;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence they have not their vision intercepted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By object new, and hence they do not need</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To recollect, through interrupted thought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that below, not sleeping, people dream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Believing they speak truth, and not believing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the last is greater sin and shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Below you do not journey by one path</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Philosophising; so transporteth you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Love of appearance and the thought thereof.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even this above here is endured</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With less disdain, than when is set aside</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Holy Writ, or when it is distorted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They think not there how much of blood it costs</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">In the Passion of Christ, and interpose herself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the sunlight reached not down below;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lies; for of its own accord the light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hid itself; whence to Spaniards and to Indians,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to the Jews, did such eclipse respond.</span>

					<span>Florence has not so many Lapi and Bindi<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2014" id="noteref-2014" epub:type="noteref">2014</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As fables such as these, that every year</span>

					<span class="i1">Are shouted from the pulpit back and forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such wise that the lambs, who do not know,</span>

					<span>Christ did not to his first disciples say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">‘Go forth, and to the world preach idle tales,’</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But unto them a true foundation gave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this so loudly sounded from their lips,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, in the warfare to enkindle Faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They made of the Evangel shields and lances.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now men go forth with jests and drolleries<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2016" id="noteref-2016" epub:type="noteref">2016</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To preach, and if but well the people laugh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hood puffs out, and nothing more is asked.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in the cowl there nestles such a bird,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2017" id="noteref-2017" epub:type="noteref">2017</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, if the common people were to see it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They would perceive what pardons they confide in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which so great on earth has grown the folly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, without proof of any testimony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To each indulgence they would flock together.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By this Saint Anthony his pig doth fatten,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2018" id="noteref-2018" epub:type="noteref">2018</a></span>

					<span class="i1">And many others, who are worse than pigs,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>But since we have digressed abundantly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the way be shortened with the time.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This nature doth so multiply itself<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2020" id="noteref-2020" epub:type="noteref">2020</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In numbers, that there never yet was speech</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor mortal fancy that can go so far.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if thou notest that which is revealed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2021" id="noteref-2021" epub:type="noteref">2021</a></span>

					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Plays round about the point that vanquished me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeming enclosed by what itself encloses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Little by little from my vision faded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat to turn mine eyes on Beatrice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My seeing nothing and my love constrained me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If what has hitherto been said of her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were all concluded in a single praise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Scant would it be to serve the present turn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only does the beauty I beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Transcend ourselves, but truly I believe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its Maker only may enjoy it all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vanquished do I confess me by this passage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than by problem of his theme was ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’ercome the comic or the tragic poet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For as the sun the sight that trembles most,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even so the memory of that sweet smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My mind depriveth of its very self.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the first day that I beheld her face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In this life, to the moment of this look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sequence of my song has ne’er been severed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now perforce this sequence must desist</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From following her beauty with my verse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As every artist at his uttermost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as I leave her to a greater fame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its arduous matter to a final close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With voice and gesture of a perfect leader</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She recommenced: “We from the greatest body<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2028" id="noteref-2028" epub:type="noteref">2028</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have issued to the heaven that is pure light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Light intellectual replete with love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Love of true good replete with ecstasy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2029" id="noteref-2029" epub:type="noteref">2029</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here shalt thou see the one host and the other<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2030" id="noteref-2030" epub:type="noteref">2030</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Paradise, and one in the same aspects</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Even as a sudden lightning that disperses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The visual spirits, so that it deprives</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The eye of impress from the strongest objects,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus round about me flashed a living light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And left me swathed around with such a veil</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Welcomes into itself with such salute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make the candle ready for its flame.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No sooner had within me these brief words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An entrance found, than I perceived myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be uplifted over my own power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I with vision new rekindled me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such that no light whatever is so pure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that mine eyes were fortified against it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And light I saw in fashion of a river<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2032" id="noteref-2032" epub:type="noteref">2032</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fulvid with its effulgence, ’twixt two banks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Depicted with an admirable Spring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of this river issued living sparks,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2033" id="noteref-2033" epub:type="noteref">2033</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on all sides sank down into the flowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like unto rubies that are set in gold;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2034" id="noteref-2034" epub:type="noteref">2034</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then, as if inebriate with the odors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as one entered issued forth another.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To have intelligence of what thou seest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pleaseth me all the more, the more it swells.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of this water it behoves thee drink</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And added: “The river and the topazes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2035" id="noteref-2035" epub:type="noteref">2035</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not that these things are difficult in themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the deficiency is on thy side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For yet thou hast not vision so exalted.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no babe that leaps so suddenly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With face towards the milk, if he awake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Much later than his usual custom is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I did, that I might make better mirrors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which flows that we therein be better made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of its length to be transformed to round.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2036" id="noteref-2036" epub:type="noteref">2036</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then as a folk who have been under masks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seem other than before, if they divest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The semblance not their own they disappeared in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus into greater pomp were changed for me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O splendor of God! by means of which I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lofty triumph of the realm veracious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give me the power to say how it I saw!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2037" id="noteref-2037" epub:type="noteref">2037</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is a light above, which visible<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2038" id="noteref-2038" epub:type="noteref">2038</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Makes the Creator unto every creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who only in beholding Him has peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it expands itself in circular form</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To such extent, that its circumference</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would be too large a girdle for the sun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The semblance of it is all made of rays</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reflected from the top of Primal Motion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which takes therefrom vitality and power.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a hill in water at its base</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When affluent most in verdure and in flowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, ranged aloft all round about the light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All who above there have from us returned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if the lowest row collect within it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So great a light, how vast the amplitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is of this Rose in its extremest leaves!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My vision in the vastness and the height</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lost not itself, but comprehended all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The quantity and quality of that gladness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There near and far nor add nor take away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For there where God immediately doth govern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The natural law in naught is relevant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the yellow of the Rose Eternal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2039" id="noteref-2039" epub:type="noteref">2039</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That spreads, and multiplies, and breathes an odor</span>

					<span class="i1">Of praise unto the ever-vernal Sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As one who silent is and fain would speak,</span>

					<span>With what amazement must I have been filled!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Truly between this and the joy, it was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My pleasure not to hear, and to be mute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a pilgrim who delighteth him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In gazing round the temple of his vow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hopes some day to retell how it was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So through the living light my way pursuing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Directed I mine eyes o’er all the ranks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now up, now down, and now all round about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faces I saw of charity persuasive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Embellished by His light and their own smile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And attitudes adorned with every grace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The general form of Paradise already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My glance had comprehended as a whole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In no part hitherto remaining fixed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And round I turned me with rekindled wish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Lady to interrogate of things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Concerning which my mind was in suspense.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One thing I meant, another answered me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I thought I should see Beatrice, and saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An Old Man habited like the glorious people.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With joy benign, in attitude of pity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to a tender father is becoming.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And “She, where is she?” instantly I said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence he: “To put an end to thy desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if thou lookest up to the third round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the first rank, again shalt thou behold her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the throne her merits have assigned her.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without reply I lifted up mine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw her, as she made herself a crown</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reflecting from herself the eternal rays.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not from that region which the highest thunders<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2052" id="noteref-2052" epub:type="noteref">2052</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is any mortal eye so far removed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As there from Beatrice my sight; but this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was nothing unto me; because her image</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Descended not to me by medium blurred.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who for my salvation didst endure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of whatsoever things I have beheld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As coming from thy power and from thy goodness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I recognise the virtue and the grace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By all those ways, by all the expedients,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Preserve towards me thy magnificence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus I implored; and she, so far away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then unto the eternal fountain turned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said the Old Man holy: “That thou mayst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accomplish perfectly thy journeying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For seeing it will discipline thy sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Farther to mount along the ray divine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wholly with love, will grant us every grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because that I her faithful Bernard am.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2053" id="noteref-2053" epub:type="noteref">2053</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he who peradventure from Croatia</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2054" id="noteref-2054" epub:type="noteref">2054</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who through its ancient fame is never sated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But says in thought, the while it is displayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now was your semblance made like unto this?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even such was I while gazing at the living</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Charity of the man, who in this world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By contemplation tasted of that peace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou son of grace, this jocund life,” began he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Will not be known to thee by keeping ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine eyes below here on the lowest place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But mark the circles to the most remote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2055" id="noteref-2055" epub:type="noteref">2055</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom this realm is subject and devoted.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The oriental part of the horizon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Surpass in splendor all the other front.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as there where we await the pole</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2056" id="noteref-2056" epub:type="noteref">2056</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The light, and is on either side diminished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So likewise that pacific oriflamme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In equal measure did the flame abate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at that centre, with their wings expanded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each differing in effulgence and in kind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw there at their sports and at their songs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A beauty smiling, which the gladness was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the eyes of all the other saints;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if I had in speaking as much wealth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in imagining, I should not dare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To attempt the smallest part of its delight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His own with such affection turned to her</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it made mine more ardent to behold.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Assumed the willing office of a teacher,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gave beginning to these holy words:</span>

					<span>“The wound that Mary closed up and anointed,</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">She is the one who opened it and pierced it.</span>

					<span>Within that order which the third seats make</span>

					<span class="i1" id="paradiso-canto-32-line-9">With Beatrice, in manner as thou seest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and her who was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ancestress of the Singer, who for dole<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2060" id="noteref-2060" epub:type="noteref">2060</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the misdeed said, ‘<i xml:lang="la">Miserere mei</i>,’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2061" id="noteref-2061" epub:type="noteref">2061</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Canst thou behold from seat to seat descending</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down in gradation, as with each one’s name</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I through the Rose go down from leaf to leaf.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And downward from the seventh row, even as</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above the same, succeed the Hebrew women,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dividing all the tresses of the flower;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because, according to the view which Faith</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Christ had taken, these are the partition</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which the sacred stairways are divided.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this side, where perfect is the flower</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With each one of its petals, seated are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those who believed in Christ who was to come.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2062" id="noteref-2062" epub:type="noteref">2062</a></span>

					<span>Upon the other side, where intersected</span>

					<span class="i1">With vacant spaces are the semicircles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are those who looked to Christ already come.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2063" id="noteref-2063" epub:type="noteref">2063</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as, upon this side, the glorious seat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the Lady of Heaven, and the other seats</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Below it, such a great division make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So opposite doth that of the great John,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2064" id="noteref-2064" epub:type="noteref">2064</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, ever holy, desert and martyrdom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Endured, and afterwards two years in Hell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And under him thus to divide were chosen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Francis, and Benedict, and Augustine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And down to us the rest from round to round.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold now the high providence divine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For one and other aspect of the Faith</span>

					<span class="i1">In equal measure shall this garden fill.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Midway the sequence of the two divisions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not by their proper merit are they seated;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by another’s under fixed conditions;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2066" id="noteref-2066" epub:type="noteref">2066</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For these are spirits one and all assoiled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before they any true election had.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well canst thou recognise it in their faces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And also in their voices puerile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou regard them well and hearken to them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now doubtest thou, and doubting thou art silent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I will loosen for thee the strong bond</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which thy subtle fancies hold thee fast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the amplitude of this domain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No casual point can possibly find place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more than sadness can, or thirst, or hunger;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by eternal law has been established</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whatever thou beholdest, so that closely</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ring is fitted to the finger here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore are these people, festinate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2067" id="noteref-2067" epub:type="noteref">2067</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto true life, not <i xml:lang="la">sine causa</i> here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More and less excellent among themselves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The King, by means of whom this realm reposes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In so great love and in so great delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That no will ventureth to ask for more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his own joyous aspect every mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Creating, at his pleasure dowers with grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Diversely; and let here the effect suffice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this is clearly and expressly noted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For you in Holy Scripture, in those twins<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2068" id="noteref-2068" epub:type="noteref">2068</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who in their mother had their anger roused.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>According to the color of the hair,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2069" id="noteref-2069" epub:type="noteref">2069</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore, with such a grace the light supreme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Consenteth that they worthily be crowned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without, then, any merit of their deeds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stationed are they in different gradations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Differing only in their first acuteness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2070" id="noteref-2070" epub:type="noteref">2070</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis true that in the early centuries,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2071" id="noteref-2071" epub:type="noteref">2071</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With innocence, to work out their salvation</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sufficient was the faith of parents only.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the earlier ages were completed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2072" id="noteref-2072" epub:type="noteref">2072</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behoved it that the males by circumcision</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto their innocent wings should virtue add;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But after that the time of grace had come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without the baptism absolute of Christ,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such innocence below there was retained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look now into the face that unto Christ<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2073" id="noteref-2073" epub:type="noteref">2073</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is able to prepare thee to see Christ.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On her did I behold so great a gladness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Created through that altitude to fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That whatsoever I had seen before</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did not suspend me in such admiration,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor show me such similitude of God.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the same Love that first descended there,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2074" id="noteref-2074" epub:type="noteref">2074</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Ave Maria, gratia plena</i>,” singing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In front of her his wings expanded wide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the canticle divine responded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From every part the court beatified,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that each sight became serener for it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2075" id="noteref-2075" epub:type="noteref">2075</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O holy father, who for me endurest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be below here, leaving the sweet place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which thou sittest by eternal lot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who is the Angel that with so much joy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the eyes is looking of our Queen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus I again recourse had to the teaching</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that one who delighted him in Mary<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2076" id="noteref-2076" epub:type="noteref">2076</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As doth the star of morning in the sun.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2077" id="noteref-2077" epub:type="noteref">2077</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Such gallantry and grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As there can be in Angel and in soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because he is the one who bore the palm</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down unto Mary, when the Son of God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To take our burden on himself decreed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now come onward with thine eyes, as I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of this most just and merciful of empires.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those two that sit above there most enrapture</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As being very near unto Augusta,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2078" id="noteref-2078" epub:type="noteref">2078</a></span>

					<span class="i1">The human species so much bitter tastes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the right thou seest that ancient father<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2080" id="noteref-2080" epub:type="noteref">2080</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The keys committed of this lovely flower.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he who all the evil days beheld,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2081" id="noteref-2081" epub:type="noteref">2081</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before his death, of her the beauteous bride</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with the spear and with the nails was won,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside him sits, and by the other rests</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That leader under whom on manna lived<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2082" id="noteref-2082" epub:type="noteref">2082</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2083" id="noteref-2083" epub:type="noteref">2083</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So well content to look upon her daughter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And opposite the eldest household father</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2085" id="noteref-2085" epub:type="noteref">2085</a></span>

					<span class="i1">When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since the moments of thy vision fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who makes the gown according to his cloth,</span>

					<span>And unto the first Love will turn our eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That looking upon Him thou penetrate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far as possible through his effulgence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,</span>

					<span class="i1">Moving thy wings believing to advance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2086" id="noteref-2086" epub:type="noteref">2086</a></span>

					<span>“Thou Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2087" id="noteref-2087" epub:type="noteref">2087</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Humble and high beyond all other creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art the one who such nobility</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To human nature gave, that its Creator</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did not disdain to make himself its creature.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within thy womb rekindled was the love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By heat of which in the eternal peace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After such wise this flower has germinated.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here unto us thou art a noonday torch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of charity, and below there among mortals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou art the living fountainhead of hope.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His aspirations without wings would fly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only thy benignity gives succor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To him who asketh it, but oftentimes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In thee compassion is, in thee is pity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In thee magnificence; in thee unites</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whate’er of goodness is in any creature.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the universe as far as here has seen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One after one the spiritual lives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Supplicate thee through grace for so much power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with his eyes he may uplift himself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Higher towards the uttermost salvation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who never burned for my own seeing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than I do for his, all of my prayers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his mortality so with thy prayers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whate’er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After so great a vision his affections.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2088" id="noteref-2088" epub:type="noteref">2088</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let thy protection conquer human movements;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">See Beatrice and all the blessed ones</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The eyes beloved and revered of God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How grateful unto her are prayers devout;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then unto the Eternal Light they turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which it is not credible could be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By any creature bent an eye so clear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who to the end of all desires</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was now approaching, even as I ought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ardor of desire within me ended.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2089" id="noteref-2089" epub:type="noteref">2089</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I should upward look; but I already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was of my own accord such as he wished;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because my sight, becoming purified,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was entering more and more into the ray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the High Light which of itself is true.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From that time forward what I saw was greater</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yields the memory unto such excess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as he is who seeth in a dream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after dreaming the imprinted passion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even such am I, for almost utterly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within my heart the sweetness born of it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2090" id="noteref-2090" epub:type="noteref">2090</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the conceits of mortals, to my mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make my tongue of so great puissance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That but a single sparkle of thy glory</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It may bequeath unto the future people;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by returning to my memory somewhat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by a little sounding in these verses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More of thy victory shall be conceived!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think the keenness of the living ray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I endured would have bewildered me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If but mine eyes had been averted from it;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2091" id="noteref-2091" epub:type="noteref">2091</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I remember that I was more bold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On this account to bear, so that I joined</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My aspect with the Glory Infinite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O grace abundant, by which I presumed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the seeing I consumed therein!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw that in its depth far down is lying</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bound up with love together in one volume,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2092" id="noteref-2092" epub:type="noteref">2092</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What through the universe in leaves is scattered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Substance, and accident, and their operations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All interfused together in such wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That what I speak of is one simple light.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2093" id="noteref-2093" epub:type="noteref">2093</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The universal fashion of this knot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Methinks I saw, since more abundantly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In saying this I feel that I rejoice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One moment is more lethargy to me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2094" id="noteref-2094" epub:type="noteref">2094</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In presence of that light one such becomes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It is impossible he e’er consent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because the good, which object is of will,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2095" id="noteref-2095" epub:type="noteref">2095</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is gathered all in this, and out of it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is defective which is perfect there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shorter henceforward will my language fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of what I yet remember, than an infant’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not because more than one unmingled semblance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was in the living light on which I looked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For it is always what it was before;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But through the sight, that fortified itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In me by looking, one appearance only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me was ever changing as I changed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2096" id="noteref-2096" epub:type="noteref">2096</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the deep and luminous subsistence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2097" id="noteref-2097" epub:type="noteref">2097</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2098" id="noteref-2098" epub:type="noteref">2098</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of threefold color and of one dimension,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the second seemed the first reflected</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Iris is by Iris, and the third</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O how all speech is feeble and falls short</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of my conceit, and this to what I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is such, ’tis not enough to call it little!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That circulation, which being thus conceived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appeared in thee as a reflected light,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2099" id="noteref-2099" epub:type="noteref">2099</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within itself, of its own very color</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed to me painted with our effigy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2100" id="noteref-2100" epub:type="noteref">2100</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the geometrician, who endeavors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To square the circle, and discovers not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By taking thought, the principle he wants,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even such was I at that new apparition;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I wished to see how the image to the circle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But my own wings were not enough for this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had it not been that then my mind there smote</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2101" id="noteref-2101" epub:type="noteref">2101</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here vigor failed the lofty fantasy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But now was turning my desire and will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a wheel that equally is moved,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2102" id="noteref-2102" epub:type="noteref">2102</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2103" id="noteref-2103" epub:type="noteref">2103</a></span>
